<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">My dear Boys</span>:&mdash;The sea stretches away from the
land,&mdash;a vast sheet of unknown possibilities. Now
gray, now blue, now slate colored, whipped into a thousand
windrows by the storm, churned into a seething
mass of frothing spume and careening bubbles, it
pleases, lulls, then terrorizes and dismays. Perpetually
intervening as a barrier between peoples and their
countries, the wild, sobbing ocean rises, falls and roars
in agony. It is a stoppage to progress and contact between
races of men and warring nations.</p>

<p>In the breasts of all souls slumbers the fire of adventure.
To penetrate the unknown, to there find
excitement, battle, treasure, so that one&rsquo;s future life
can be one of ease and indolence&mdash;for this men have
sacrificed the more stable occupations on land in order
to push recklessly across the death-dealing billows.
They have battled with the elements; they have suffered
dread diseases; they have been tormented with
thirst; with a torrid sun and with strange weather;
they have sorrowed and they have sinned in order to
gain fame, fortune, and renown. On the wide sweep
of the ocean, even as on the rolling plateau of the once
uninhabited prairie, many a harrowing tragedy has
been enacted. These dramas have often had no chronicler,&mdash;the
battle was fought out in the silence of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg&nbsp;viii]</a></span>
watery waste, and there has been no tongue to tell of
the solitary conflict and the unseen strife.</p>

<p>Of sea fighters there have been many: the pirate, the
fillibusterer, the man-of-warsman, and the privateer.
The first was primarily a ruffian and, secondarily, a
brute, although now and again there were pirates who
shone by contrast only. The fillibusterer was also engaged
in lawless fighting on the sea and to this service
were attracted the more daring and adventurous souls
who swarmed about the shipping ports in search of
employment and pelf. The man-of-warsman was the
legitimate defender of his country&rsquo;s interests and
fought in the open, without fear of death or imprisonment
from his own people. The privateersman&mdash;a
combination of all three&mdash;was the harpy of the rolling
ocean, a vulture preying upon the merchant marine of
the enemy to his country, attacking only those weaker
than himself, scudding off at the advent of men-of-warsmen,
and hovering where the guileless merchantman
passed by. The privateersman was a gentleman
adventurer, a protected pirate, a social highwayman of
the waters. He throve, grew lusty, and prospered,&mdash;a
robber legitimized by the laws of his own people.</p>

<p>So these hardy men went out upon the water, sailed
forth beneath the white spread of new-made canvas,
and, midst the creaking of spars, the slapping of ropes,
the scream of the hawser, the groan of the windlass,
and the ruck and roar of wave-beaten wood, carved out
their destinies. They fought. They bled. They conquered
and were defeated. In the hot struggle and the
desperate attack they played their parts even as the old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg&nbsp;ix]</a></span>
Vikings of Norway and the sea rovers of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Hark to the stories of those wild sea robbers!
Listen to the tales of the adventurous pillagers of the
rolling ocean! And&mdash;as your blood is red and you,
yourself, are fond of adventure&mdash;ponder upon these
histories with satisfaction, for these stalwart seamen</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Fought and sailed and took a prize<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even as it was their right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drank a glass and kissed a maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the volleys of a fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Don&rsquo;t</em> begrudge their lives of danger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>You</em> are better off by far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, if war again comes,&mdash;stranger,<br /></span>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE torches fluttered from the walls of a burial
vault in ancient Venice. Two shrouded figures
leaned over the body of a dead warrior, and,
as they gazed upon the wax-like features, their eyes
were filled with tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said the taller fellow. &ldquo;He has indeed led
the stalwart life. Here are five and thirty wounds upon
the body of our most renowned compatriot. He was
a true hero.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak correctly, O Knight,&rdquo; answered the
other. &ldquo;Carlo Zeno was the real warrior without fear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
and without reproach. He has fared badly at the hands
of the Republic. But then,&mdash;is this not life? Those
most worthy seem never to receive their just compensation
during their living hours. It is only when
they are dead that a tardy public gives them some recognition
of the great deeds which they have done, the
battles which they have fought, and the honor which
they have brought to their native land. Alas! poor
Zeno! He&mdash;the true patriot&mdash;has had but scant
and petty praise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying the two noble Venetians covered the prostrate
form of the dead warrior&mdash;for they had lifted
the brown robe which enshrouded him&mdash;and, with
slow faltering steps, they left the gloomy chamber of
death.</p>

<p>Who was this Venetian soldier, who, covered with
the marks of battle, lay in his last sleep? Who&mdash;this
hero of war&rsquo;s alarms? This patriotic leader of the
rough-and-ready rovers of the sea?</p>

<p>It was Carlo Zeno,&mdash;a man of the best blood of
Venice,&mdash;who, commanding fighting men and fighting
ships, had battled strenuously and well for his
native country.</p>

<p>The son of Pietro Zeno and Agnese Dandolo, this
famous Venetian had been well bred to the shock of
battle, for his father was for some time Governor of
Padua, and had won a great struggle against the
Turks, when the careening galleys of the Venetian
Squadron grappled blindly with the aggressive men of
the Ottoman Empire. There were ten children in the
family and little Carlo was named after the Emperor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
Charles IV, who sent a retainer to the baptism of the
future seaman, saying, &ldquo;I wish the child well. He
has a brave and noble father and I trust that his future
will be auspicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Carlo was destined for the Church, and, with
a Latin eulogium in his pocket (which his Venetian
school-master had written out for him) was sent to
the court of the Pope at Avignon. The sweet-faced
boy was but seven years of age. He knelt before the
prelate and his retainers, reciting the piece of prose
with such precision, grace, and charm, that all were
moved by his beauty, his memory, his spirit, and his
liveliness of person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are indeed a noble youth,&rdquo; cried the Pope.
&ldquo;You shall come into my household. There you
shall receive an education and shall be a canon of the
cathedral of Patras, with a rich benefice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But little Carlo did not remain. Although dressed
like a mimic priest and taught with great care, the
hot blood of youth welled in his veins and made him
long for a life more active and more dangerous. So
he looked about for adventure so thoroughly that he
was soon able to have his first narrow escape, and a
part in one of those many brawls which were to
come to him during his career of war and adventure.</p>

<p>Sent by his relations to the University of Padua,
he was returning to Venice from the country, one
day, when a man leaped upon him as he walked down
a narrow road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; cried Carlo fearfully.</p>

<p>But the fellow did not answer. Instead,&mdash;he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
struck him suddenly with a stout cudgel&mdash;knocked
him senseless on the turf, took all the valuables which
he had, and ran silently away into the gloom.</p>

<p>Little Carlo came to his senses after many hours,
and, staggering forward with weakened steps, reached
Mestre, where kind friends dressed his wounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall catch this assailant,&rdquo; cried he, when he had
revived. &ldquo;He shall rue the day that he ever touched
the person of Carlo Zeno.&rdquo; And forthwith he secured
a number of bloodhounds with which to track the
cowardly ruffian of the highway.</p>

<p>Luck was with the future commander of the galleons
and fighting men. He ran the scurvy assailant to
earth, like a fox. He captured him, bound him and
handed him over to the justice of Padua,&mdash;where&mdash;for
the heinousness of the offense&mdash;the man was
executed. So ended the first conflict in which the
renowned Carlo Zeno was engaged,&mdash;successfully&mdash;as
did most of his later battles.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards young Zeno returned to his
studies at the University, but here&mdash;as a lover of
excitement&mdash;he fell into bad company. Alas! he
took to gambling, and frittered away all of his ready
money, so that he had to sell his books in order to
play. The profit from these was soon gone. He was
bankrupt at the early age of seventeen.</p>

<p>Ashamed to go home, the future sea rover disappeared
from Padua and joined a fighting band of
mercenaries (paid soldiers) who were in the employ
of a wealthy Italian Prince. He was not heard of for
full five years. Thus, his relatives gave him up for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
dead, and, when&mdash;one day&mdash;he suddenly stalked
into the house of his parents, his brothers and sisters
set up a great shout of wonder and amazement.
&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried they, &ldquo;the dead has returned to his
own. This is no ghost, for he speaks our own native
tongue. Carlo Zeno, you shall be given the best that
we have, for we believed that you had gone to another
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pleased and overwhelmed with affection, young
Carlo stayed for a time with his family, and then&mdash;thinking
that, as he had been trained for the priesthood,
he had best take charge of his canonry of Patras&mdash;he
went to Greece.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hah! my fine fellow,&rdquo; said the Governor, when
he first saw him, &ldquo;I hear that you are fond of fighting.
It is well. The Turks are very troublesome, just now,
and they need some stout Venetian blood to hold them
in check. You must assist us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; cried Zeno with spirit, and, he
had not been there a week before the Ottomans
swooped down upon the city, bent upon its demolition.
The young Venetian sallied forth&mdash;with numerous
fighting men&mdash;to meet them, and, in the first clash of
arms, received such a gaping wound that he was given
up for dead. In fact, when carried to the city, he was
considered to be without life, was stretched upon a
long settee, was clothed in a white sheet, and prepared
for interment. But in the early morning he suddenly
opened his eyes, gazed wonderingly at the white shroud
which covered him, and cried, with no ill humor,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet, my friends. Carlo Zeno will disappoint
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
all your fondest hopes. Once more I am of the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, so saying, he scrambled to his feet, much to
the dismay of the sorrowing Venetians, who had been
carefully spreading a number of flowers upon the
prostrate form of the supposedly dead warrior.</p>

<p>But so weak was the youthful hero that he had to
be taken to Venice in order to recover. When strong
again he resumed his studies for the ministry and was
sent to Patras, a city that was soon threatened by
an army of twelve thousand Cypriotes and Frenchmen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Zeno,&rdquo; cried the Bishop of Patras to the
virile young stripling. &ldquo;We have seven hundred
riders in our city. With this mere handful, you must
defend us against our enemies. The odds are fifteen
to one against you. But you must struggle valiantly
to save our beautiful capital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye! Sire!&rdquo; cried the youthful student of church
history. &ldquo;I shall do my best to free your capital from
these invaders. May the God of Hosts be with us!
My men salute you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying the valiant youth led his small and ill
drilled company against the besiegers, and, so greatly
did he harass his adversaries, that they abandoned the
enterprise, at the end of six months; made peace; and
retired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hail to Zeno!&rdquo; cried many of the soldiers. &ldquo;He
is a leader well worth our respect. Without him the
great city would have surely fallen. Yea! Hail to
young Zeno.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
These words of praise reached the ears of a certain
Greek Knight named Simon, and so roused his envy,
that he audaciously accused Carlo of treachery, which
was soon told to the hot-headed young warrior. He
acted as one would well expect of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I challenge you to single combat,&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;The
duel shall be fought in Naples under the eye of Queen
Johanna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In vain Carlo&rsquo;s friends besought him to forgive the
loose-tongued Simon&mdash;his patron, the Bishop, exhausted
his eloquence in the endeavor to reconcile the
two. The hot blood of youth would out. It was fight
and no compromise. But before the trial, the bold and
unyielding soldier threw up his position with the
Church and married a rich and noble lady of Clarenta,
whose fortune well supplanted the large income which
he had forfeited by his resignation.</p>

<p>Now honor called for deeds. Almost immediately
he was obliged to leave for Naples in order to meet the
detractor of his valor, and, to his surprise, the Queen
spoke lightly of the quarrel. &ldquo;It is a question of law,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;An inquiry shall be had. There must be
no bloodshed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An inquiry was therefore in order, and it was a
thorough one. &ldquo;Simon is in the wrong,&rdquo; said the
fellow acting as clerk for those sitting upon the case.
&ldquo;He must pay all the expenses to which Zeno has
been put, and there shall be no duel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My honor has been cleared,&rdquo; cried Zeno. &ldquo;I must
return to Greece.&rdquo; There&mdash;strange as it might seem&mdash;he
was at once named Governor of a province,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
though not yet twenty-three. Events were going well
with him. But his wife died, he was cheated of his
dowry by her relations, and so he turned once more to
Venice,&mdash;saddened, older and nearly penniless. The
wheel of fortune had turned badly for this leader of
fighting men and future general of white-winged
galleons of the sea.</p>

<p>But now there was a really good fight&mdash;such a
fight as all true sailors love&mdash;a fight which tested the
grit and courage of Zeno to the full. It was the first
of those heroic deeds of arms which shed undying
lustre on his name, and marked him as a seaman of
the first rank,&mdash;a captain of true courage, resources
and ambition.</p>

<p>The Genoese (or inhabitants of Genoa) and the
Venetians, were continually at war in these days, and
when&mdash;in patriotic zeal&mdash;Carlo Zeno seized the
island of Tenedos, the Venetian Senate, fearing lest
the Genoese would seek to recover the lost possession,
sent a fleet of fifteen ships to guard it, under one Pietro
Mocenigo. There were also two other vessels, one
commanded by Carlo Zeno himself. The mass of
galleys floated on to Constantinople, for the Greeks
had allied themselves with the Genoese, had seized a
Venetian man-of-war, which had been captured, and
had then retired. Three lumbering hulks were left to
protect the fair isle of Tenedos,&mdash;under Zeno, the
war-like Venetian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha,&rdquo; said a Genoese seaman. &ldquo;There are but
three galleys left to save our isle of Tenedos. We
shall soon take it with our superior force. Forward,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
O sailors! We&rsquo;ll have revenge for the attack of the
wild men from Venice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On! on!&rdquo; cried the Genoese seamen, and without
further ado, twenty-two galleys careened forward,
their white sails bellying in the wind, their hawsers
groaning, spars creaking, and sailors chattering like
magpies on a May morning.</p>

<p>Carlo Zeno had only three hundred regular soldiers
and a few archers, but he occupied the suburbs of the
town and waited for the attackers to land. This they
did in goodly numbers, for the sea was calm and motionless,
although it was the month of November.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men!&rdquo; cried the intrepid Zeno, &ldquo;you are few.
The enemy are as numerous as blades of grass. Do
your duty! Fight like Trojans, and, if you win, your
grateful countrymen will treat you as heroes should be
respected. Never say die, and let every arrow find an
opening in the armor of the enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Genoese came on with shouts of expectancy,
but they were met with a far warmer reception than
they had anticipated. The air was filled with flying
arrows, as, crouching low behind quickly constructed
redoubts, the followers of the stout-souled Zeno busily
stretched their bowstrings, and shot their feathered
barbs into the mass of crowding seamen. Savage
shouts and hoarse cries of anguish, rose from both
attackers and attacked, while the voice of Zeno, shrilled
high above the battle&rsquo;s din, crying: &ldquo;Shoot carefully,
my men, do not let them defeat us, for the eyes of
Venice are upon you.&rdquo; So they struggled and bled,
until the shadows began to fall, when&mdash;realizing that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
they were unable to take the courageous Venetians&mdash;the
Genoese withdrew to their ships.</p>

<p>There was laughter and song around the camp fires
of Zeno&rsquo;s little band, that night, but their leader spoke
critically of the morrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sleep well, my men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for I know that
our foes are well angered at the beating we have given
them. Next morn we shall again be at war. Let us
keep our courage and have as a battle cry, &lsquo;Venice!
No retreat and no quarter!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>When morning dawned the Genoese were seen to
land engines of war, with the apparent intention of
laying siege to the town. Their preparations showed
that they meant to attack upon the side farthest from
the castle, so Carlo Zeno&mdash;the quick-witted&mdash;placed
a number of his men in ambush, among a collection of
half-ruined and empty houses which stood in that
quarter. &ldquo;Stay here, my men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and when
the enemy has advanced, charge them with fury. We
must win to-day, or we will be disgraced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the rest of the Venetians had retreated
inland, and, crouching low behind a screen of brush,
waited patiently for the Genoese to come up. &ldquo;Be
cautious,&rdquo; cried Zeno, &ldquo;and when the enemy is within
striking distance, charge with all the fury which you
possess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye! Aye! Good master,&rdquo; cried the stubborn
soldiers. &ldquo;We mark well what you tell us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not long afterwards the attacking party came in
view, and, without suspecting what lay in front, advanced
with quick gait towards the supposedly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
defenseless town. But suddenly, with a wild yell, the
followers of Zeno leaped from behind the screening
bushes, and dashed towards them. At the same instant,
the soldiers who had been placed in hiding, attacked
suddenly from the rear. Arrows poured into
the ranks of the Genoese, and they fell like wheat before
the scythe of the reaper. Hoarse shouts, groans,
and cries of victory and death, welled above the battle&rsquo;s
din.</p>

<p>In the midst of this affair Carlo Zeno gave a cry of
pain. An arrow (poisoned &rsquo;tis said) had entered his
leg and struck him to the ground. But, nothing
daunted, he rose to cry shrilly to his men, &ldquo;On! On!
Drive them to the ocean.&rdquo; And, so well did his soldiers
follow these commands, that the Genoese fled in
confusion and disorder to their ships. The day was
won.</p>

<p>As was natural, Zeno paid no attention to his wound,
and, when the enemy hurried to shore the next day
for another attack, they were greeted with such a terrific
discharge of artillery that they gave up their idea
of capturing the island and sailed away amidst cries of
derision from the delighted Venetians.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried they. &ldquo;Hurrah for Zeno!&rdquo; But
so exhausted was the intrepid leader by reason of his
wound that he fell into a spasm as if about to die. His
iron constitution pulled him through, however, and
soon he and the faithful band returned to Venice,
covered with glory, and full satisfied with their hard
won victory.</p>

<p>The daring Zeno was well deserving of praise, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
he had beaten a fleet and an army by sheer genius, with
three ships and a handful of men. To Venice had
been preserved the valuable island which guards the
entrance to the Dardanelles, and to her it was to remain
for years, although the Genoese tried many times and
oft to wrest it from her grasp.</p>

<p>Now came another struggle&mdash;the war of Chioggia&mdash;a
struggle in which Carlo Zeno played a great and
noble part,&mdash;a part, in fact, that has made his name
a byword among the grateful Venetians: a part in
which he displayed a leadership quite equal to that of
a Drake, or a Hawkins, and led his fighting galleons
with all the courage of a lion. Hark, then, to the
story of this unfortunate affair! Hark! and let your
sympathy be stirred for Carlo Zeno, the indefatigable
navigator of the clumsy shipping of the Italian peninsula!</p>

<p>For years the Republics of Genoa and Venice remained
at peace, but, for years the merchants of the
two countries had endeavored to outwit each other in
trade; and, thus, when the Genoese seized several
Venetian ships with rich cargoes, in 1350, and refused
to give them up, war broke out between the rival
Republics. In two engagements at sea, the Venetians
were defeated; but in a third they were victorious, and
forever sullied the banner of St. Mark, which flew
from their Admiral&rsquo;s mast-head, by causing nearly
five thousand prisoners of war to be drowned. Fired
by a desire for immediate revenge upon their foe, the
Genoese hurried a mighty fleet to sea, and ravaged the
Italian coast up to the very doors of Venice itself.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
Several other engagements followed, in most of which
the Venetians were defeated; and then there were
twenty years of peace before another conflict.</p>

<p>Finally war broke out afresh. Angry and vindictive,
the Genoese bore down upon the Venetian coast in
numerous lumbering galleys, determined&mdash;this time&mdash;to
reach Venice itself, and to sack this rich and populous
city. With little difficulty they captured Chioggia,
a seaport, a populous city and the key to the lagoons
which led to the heart of the capital. They advanced
to the very outskirts of Venice, and their cries of joyous
vindictiveness sounded strangely near to the now
terrified inhabitants, who, rallying around their old
generals and city fathers, were determined to fight to
the last ditch.</p>

<p>As winter came, the victoriously aggressive Genoese
retreated to Chioggia, withdrawing their fleet into the
safe harbor to await the spring; leaving only two or
three galleys to cruise before the entrance, in case the
now angered Venetians should attack. But they were
to be rudely awakened from their fancied seclusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lead us on, O Pisani,&rdquo; the Venetians had cried in
the broad market space of their beloved city. &ldquo;We
must and will drive these invaders into their own
country. Never have we received before such insults.
On! On! to Chioggia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, silent and vengeful, the Venetian fleet stole out
to sea on the evening of December twenty-first. There
were thirty-four galleys, sixty smaller armed vessels,
and hundreds of flat-bottomed boats. Pisani was in
the rear, towing two heavy, old hulks, laden with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
stones, to sink in the entrance of the harbor and bottle
up the fleet, even as the Americans were to sink the
<i>Merrimac</i> in the Harbor of Santiago, many years
afterwards.</p>

<p>The Genoese were unready. The cruisers, on duty as
sentinels, were not where they should have been, and
so the gallant Pisani scuttled the hulks across the harbor
entrance and caught the bold marauders like rats
in a trap. The fleet of the enemy was paralyzed, particularly
as another river&rsquo;s mouth, some two miles
southward, was also blockaded. Smiles of satisfaction
shone upon the faces of the outraged Venetians.</p>

<p>Carlo Zeno was hurrying up with a strong fleet
manned by veteran seamen, but the now victorious
followers of Pisani wished to return to Venice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the Christmas season,&rdquo; cried many. &ldquo;We
have fought like lions. We have shut up our enemy.
We have averted the extreme danger. Let us return
to our wives and our children!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot go,&rdquo; said Pisani, sternly. &ldquo;You are
the entire male population of Venice. Without you the
great expedition will come to naught, and all of our
toil will have been thrown away. Only be calm.
Carlo Zeno will soon be here, and we can then take
Chioggia!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alas! Like Columbus, he saw himself upon the
verge of losing the result of all his labor for lack of
confidence in him upon the part of his men. He could
not keep them by force, so wearily and anxiously he
scanned the horizon for signs of an approaching sail.</p>

<p>The days went slowly by for the lion-hearted Pisani.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
Carlo Zeno did not come. Day after day the valiant
leader fearfully looked for the white-winged canvas
of a Venetian galleon, but none came to view. On the
thirtieth day of December his men were very mutinous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will seize the ships and return to-morrow to
Venice,&rdquo; cried several. &ldquo;We have had enough of
war. Our wives and daughters cry to us to return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pisani was desperate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Carlo Zeno does not come in forty-eight hours,
the fleet may return to Lido,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Meanwhile,
keep your guns shooting at the enemy. We must
make these Genoese feel that we shall soon attack in
force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Pisani&rsquo;s heart was leaden. Where, yes, where
was Zeno? New Year&rsquo;s Day came, and, by his promise,
he must let the Venetians go. What did this
mean for him? It meant the fall of Venice, the end
of the Republic, the destruction of the population with
all that they possessed. He&mdash;their idol, their leader
for ten days&mdash;could no longer lead, for the Venetians
could not bear a little cold and hardship for his
sake. Sad&mdash;yes, sad, indeed&mdash;was the face of the
stout seaman as he gave one last despairing glance at
the horizon.</p>

<p>Ha! What was that? A thin, white mark against
the distant blue! It grew larger and clearer. It was
the sail of a galley. Another, and another, and another
hove in sight,&mdash;eighteen in all, and driving
along swiftly before a heavy wind. But, were they
hostile, or friendly? That was the question. Was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
it Zeno, or were these more galleons of the Genoese?
Then, joy shone in the keen eyes of Pisani, for the
banner of St. Mark fluttered from the peak of the
foremost ship, and floated fair upon the morning
breeze. Hurrah! It was Carlo Zeno, the lion-hearted.</p>

<p>God speed brave Zeno! He had been twice
wounded in fights along the coast, en route, but nothing
could diminish his energy, or dampen his ardor.
He had laid waste the Genoese coast; he had intercepted
convoys of grain; he had harassed the enemy&rsquo;s
commerce in the East, and he had captured a huge
vessel of theirs with five hundred thousand pieces of
gold. Marvellous Zeno! Brave, courageous Venetian
sea-dog, you are just in the nick of time!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks be to Heaven that you have come,&rdquo; cried
Pisani, tears welling to his eyes. &ldquo;Now we will go
in and take Chioggia. It means the end of the war
for us. Again, I say, thanks be to Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With renewed hope and confidence the Venetians
now pushed the siege. Seeing that their fleet could
never escape, the Genoese started to dig a canal to the
open sea, by which the boats could be brought off
during the night. The work was begun, but Carlo
Zeno discovered it in time. Volunteers were called
for, a force was soon landed, and, under the leadership
of Zeno, marched to intercept the diggers of this,
the only means of escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Venetians are going towards &lsquo;Little
Chioggia,&rsquo;&rdquo; cried many of the Genoese. &ldquo;We must
hasten there to stop them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
But Zeno had only made a feint in this direction.
Throwing his main force in the rear of the Genoese,
he soon began to cut them up badly. They were
seized with a panic. They fled towards the bridge of
Chioggia, trampling upon each other as they ran, pursued
and slashed to ribbons by Zeno&rsquo;s men. The
bridge broke beneath the weight of the fugitives and
hundreds were drowned in the canal, while thousands
perished near the head of this fateful causeway. It
was a great and signal victory for Zeno; the intrepid
sea-dog and campaigner on land.</p>

<p>This was a death blow. That night some of the
garrison hastened to desert, and, as the siege progressed,
the drinking water began to fail, the food
gave out, and starvation stared the holders of Chioggia
in the face. On the twenty-fourth of June the city
surrendered; and four thousand one hundred and
seventy Genoese, with two hundred Paduans&mdash;ghastly
and emaciated&mdash;more like moving corpses
than living beings&mdash;marched out to lay down their
arms. Seventeen galleys, also, were handed over to
the Venetians: the war-worn relics of the once powerful
fleet which had menaced Venice itself.</p>

<p>As a feat of generalship, Pisani&rsquo;s blockade of the
Genoese fleet is rivalled by Sampson&rsquo;s blockade of
Cervera&rsquo;s squadron at Santiago in 1898, and the military
operation by which Carlo Zeno tempted the garrison
of Brondolo into the trap which he had set for
them, and drove them, like a flock of sheep into
Chioggia, by sunset, is surely a splendid feat of arms.
All honor to this intrepid sea-dog of old Venice!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
How fickle is Dame Fortune! Jealous of the reputation
of this noble Venetian, the patricians, whose
advice, during the war, he had consistently declined to
follow; refused to make him a Doge of the City. It
was thought that the election of the bravest captain of
the day might be dangerous to the Republic. Instead
of doing him honor, they imprisoned him; and was
he not the noblest patriot of them all?</p>

<p>When over seventy years of age,&mdash;the greatest and
truest Venetian&mdash;loaned a small sum of money to
the Prince Carrara, once a power in Venetian politics.
He had saved his country from destruction. He had
served her with the most perfect integrity. Yet, he
reaped the reward which fell to the share of nearly
every distinguished Venetian; he was feared by the
government; hated by the nobles whom he had out-stripped
in honor, and was condemned to prison by
men who were not worthy to loose the latchet of his
shoes. Although he had often paid the mercenary soldiers
to fight for Venice, in the War of Chioggia, from
his own pocket, he was sent to jail for loaning money
to an unfortunate political refugee.</p>

<p>When called before the Council of Ten on the night
of the twentieth of January, 1406, the warrant for his
examination authorized the use of torture. But even
the Ten hesitated at this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a brave man,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;Pray allow him
to go untouched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prisoner admitted that he had loaned the money.
His explanation was both honorable and clear. But
the Ten were obdurate that night.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
&ldquo;He shall go to the Pozzi prison for a year,&rdquo; said
they. &ldquo;Besides this, he shall suffer the perpetual loss
of all offices which he has held.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Like a brave man, Carlo Zeno accepted the sentence
without a murmur, and his sturdy frame did not suffer
from the confinement. For twelve years longer he
lived in perfect health; made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem;
commanded the troops of the Republic once
again; defeated the Cypriotes, and died peacefully,&mdash;a
warrior with a name of undiminished lustre, most
foully tarnished by his own compatriots. His is a
reputation of undying glory, that of his judges is
that of eternal shame. All honor to Carlo Zeno, the
valorous Venetian, who could fight a ship as well as a
squadron of foot soldiers on land! <i>Salve, Venetia!</i></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>AKE care, boy, you will fall overboard.
Take care and do not play with your brother
near the edge of our good ship, for the
water here is deep, and I know that you can swim
but ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
The man who spoke was a rough, grizzled sea-dog,
clad in an old jersey and tarpaulins. He stood upon
the deck of an aged, dismantled warship, which&mdash;anchored
in the shallow water near Chatham, England,&mdash;swung
to and fro in the eddying currents.
Around him, upon the unwashed deck, scampered a
swarm of little children, twelve in all, and all of them
his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, Father,&rdquo; spoke the curly-haired
youngster. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mind what you tell me. You&rsquo;re
wrong, though, when you say that I cannot swim, for
I can, even to yonder shore. Do you want to see me
do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; chuckled the stout seaman. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
a boy of courage, Francis. That I can well see. But
do not try the water. It is cold and you will have
a cramp and go under. Stick to the quarter-deck.&rdquo;
And laughing softly to himself, he went below, where
a strong smell of cooking showed that there was something
upon the galley stove to feed his hungry crew
of youthful Englishmen.</p>

<p>It was surely a strange house to bring up a troop
of merry children in. The sound of wind and waves
was familiar to them at night and they grew to be
strong and fearless. But is not this the proper way
to rear a sea-dog?</p>

<p>These little ducklings, descended from a Drake,
must have early set their hearts upon adventure and
a seafaring life. In fact, one of them, young Francis,
was to be one of the best known seamen of the centuries
and knighted for his services to the Crown.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
Reared in a ship, he, by nature, loved the sea as only
a child of the ocean could have done. The brine ran
in his blood.</p>

<p>Being the son of a poor man, he was apprenticed
to a master of a small vessel which used to coast along
the shore and carry merchandise to France and the
Netherlands. He learned his business well. So well,
indeed, that at the death of the master of the
vessel it was bequeathed &ldquo;to Francis Drake, because
he was diligent and painstaking and pleased the
old man, his master, by his industry.&rdquo; But the
gallant, young sea-dog grew weary of the tiny
barque.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It only creeps along the shore,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want
to get out upon the ocean and see the world. I will
therefore enlist with my stout kinsmen, the Hawkins
brothers, rich merchants both, who build and sail their
own ships.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This he did, and thus began the roving life of
Francis Drake: dare-devil and scourge of the West
Indian waters.</p>

<p>About fifty years before this lusty mariner had been
born, America was discovered by Christopher Columbus&mdash;an
Italian sailor in the service of Spain&mdash;and
this powerful country had seized a great part of the
new found land. There was no love lost between the
Spaniards and the men from the cold, northern British
Isles and thus Francis Drake spent his entire career
battling with the black-haired, rapacious, and avaricious
adventurers who flew the banner of King Philip
of Arragon. Sometimes he was defeated, more often
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
he was successful. Hark, then, to the tale of his many
desperate encounters upon the wide waters of the
surging Atlantic.</p>

<p>Drake had said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to sea with the Hawkins
and view the world,&rdquo; and, as John Hawkins was
just about to sail for the West Indies in six ships, the
youthful and eager mariner was given an opportunity
to command a vessel called the <i>Judith</i>. The fleet at
first had good success. Slaves were captured upon the
African coast and were sold in the West Indies,
though with difficulty, because the Spaniards had been
forbidden by their king to trade with the English.
Laden with treasure and spices, the ships were about
to start for home, when fearful storms beset them.
Their beams were badly shattered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must seek a haven,&rdquo; cried Hawkins. &ldquo;Ready
about and steer for Vera Cruz, the port of the City
of Mexico! There we can buy food and repair our
fleet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well,&rdquo; cried his men, and, aiming for the
sheltering harbor, they soon ploughed into the smooth
water of the bay. But there was consternation among
the Spaniards of the town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have treasure here,&rdquo; they whispered to each
other. &ldquo;See, those English dogs have come to rob
us! We must fight, brothers, and fight hard to keep
the cruel Islanders away.&rdquo; And they oiled their pistols
and sharpened their cutlasses upon their grindstones.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">SIR FRANCIS DRAKE.</p>

<p>But luck was with the inhabitants of Vera Cruz.
Next morning thirteen careening galleys swept into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
the quiet waters of the bay and joy shone in the black
eyes of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a Mexican fleet,&rdquo; cried they. &ldquo;It returns
with a new Viceroy or Governor, from good King
Philip of Spain.&rdquo; And they laughed derisively.</p>

<p>But in the breasts of Drake and Hawkins there was
doubt and suspicion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are sure to attack us,&rdquo; said Hawkins, moving
among his men. &ldquo;Let every fellow be upon his
guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Spanish were full of bowings and scrapings.
They protested their deep friendship for the English
and wished to be moored alongside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are very glad to see you, English brothers,&rdquo;
said one. &ldquo;We welcome you to the traffic and trade
of the far East.&rdquo; So they peacefully dropped anchor
near the suspicious men of England, still smiling, singing,
and cheerfully waving a welcome to the none-too-happy
sailors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Avast,&rdquo; cried Francis Drake, &ldquo;and sleep on your
arms, my Hearties, for to-morrow there&rsquo;ll be trouble,
or else my blood&rsquo;s not British.&rdquo; He was but a young
man, yet he had guessed correctly.</p>

<p>As the first glimmer of day shone in the dim horizon,
a shot awoke the stillness of the morn. Another
and another followed in rapid succession. Then
<em>boom!</em> a cannon roared, and a great iron ball buried
itself in the decking of the <i>Jesus</i>; the flagship of
gallant Hawkins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re attacked,&rdquo; cried Drake. &ldquo;Man the decks!
Up sails and steer to sea! Fight as you never fought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
before! Strike and strike hard for dear old England!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But his warning almost came too late, for two
Spanish galleons ranged alongside and swung grappling
irons into his rigging in order to close with the
moving vessel. The Englishmen struck at them with
oars and hand-spikes, knocking the tentacles of the
on-coming octopus aside, and, with sails flying and
shots rattling, the <i>Judith</i> bore towards the open sea.</p>

<p>The fight was now furious. Two of the English
ships were sunk and the <i>Jesus</i>, Hawkins&rsquo; own boat,
was so badly damaged that she lay apparently helpless
in the trough of the surging ocean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Back, my Hearties,&rdquo; cried Drake, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll see
what we can do to save our gallant captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So back they sailed, and, firing their little cannon
with rapidity, soon held off the Spanish ship which
threatened Hawkins himself with capture. Some of
the English sailors jumped into their boats and rowed
away, some gave in to the Spaniards, and some fought
relentlessly. Thus raged the battle until the evening.</p>

<p>As night fell, Drake ordered the <i>Judith</i> to put to
sea, Hawkins followed, and wandering about in these
unknown parts, with little water and a scarcity of
food, hunger forced the weary sailors to eat hides,
cats, dogs, mice, rats, parrots and monkeys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the troublesome voyage,&rdquo; wrote Hawkins,
and such, indeed, it had proved to be. Some of the
sailors asked to be placed on land rather than risk
shipwreck and starvation in the overcrowded boat.
Some of them reached England after years of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
suffering and weary journeying to and fro. Some were
captured by the Spaniards and were put to death as
heretics. A few were sent to the galleys as slaves.
Others, more fortunate, were rowed ashore to serve
in monasteries, where the monks made kind and gentle
masters.</p>

<p>And what of the youthful and danger-loving
Drake? Five days before the wind-swept <i>Jesus</i> struggled
into Plymouth harbor with Hawkins and a famine-driven
crew, Drake and his own adventurous Englishmen
steered the little <i>Judith</i> to the rocky headland
which hides this sheltering refuge from the fury of
the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am indeed right glad to reach Merrie England
again,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for we have had a rough and dangerous
voyage. The Spaniards are treacherous dogs.
They betrayed us, and henceforth I, for one, shall
show them no quarter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying he journeyed to London to see the good
Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible for me to wage war upon Philip
of Spain,&rdquo; said the valiant Mistress of England&rsquo;s destinies,
when she heard his story of loss of kinsmen,
friends and goods of great value. &ldquo;I have a poor
country. The navy of my fathers has been ruined. I
have no proper army with which to avenge the treachery
of Spain, and I have trouble with both France
and Scotland. If you would have revenge, take matters
into your own hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philip is the mightiest monarch in the world to-day,&rdquo;
answered the well-bronzed mariner, bowing low.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am only a humble seafarer without either ships
or money, but, most gracious Majesty, I am going
to help myself in my quarrel with the King of Spain.
From henceforth there will be war to the death between
myself and the men of the south.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The good Queen smiled, for she truly loved a valiant
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May God be with you,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>It was not long before the danger-loving mariner
was again headed for the West Indies and the Spanish
Main, with a crew of seventy-three men and boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We believe in our leader,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;He will
take us on to fortune and to fame.&rdquo; And this was
the sentiment of all, for who does not love a voyage
after gold and treasure?</p>

<p>Ploughing relentlessly across the deep, the two ships
which carried these roving blades, reached the palm-clad
West Indies in twenty-five days. All were cheerful
and gay, for before them was danger, excitement,
battle, and Spanish gold. &ldquo;Lead on, Captain Drake,&rdquo;
cried one of the men. &ldquo;We wish to land at Plymouth
with our pockets stuffed with Spanish dubloons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to the seaport of Nombre de Dios,&rdquo;
said the bluff sea ranger. &ldquo;There is gold and silver
in this spot, and by the hogshead. Furthermore,&rdquo; he
added chuckling, &ldquo;most of it will be in the hold of
our stout ships, the <i>Pascha</i> and the <i>Swan</i>, before another
moon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the sailors were drilled in attack and sword play,
while arms were distributed, which, up to now, had
been kept &ldquo;very fair and safe in good casks.&rdquo; All
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
were in a cheerful mood, for the excitement of battle
had begun to stir the hot blood in their veins.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, the pinnaces (which had been
carried on deck) were launched, and climbing aboard,
the men of Merrie England set sail for the Spanish
town. They lay under the shore, out of sight, until
dark. Then they rowed with muffled oars to the
shadows of the precipitous cliffs which here jutted
into the rolling ocean, and quietly awaited the dawn.</p>

<p>At three in the morning, while the silvery light of
a half moon was just reddened with the first flush of
dawn, the eager buccaneers landed upon the sandy
beach. &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; cried a youth, &ldquo;We are already
discovered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke, the noise of bells, drums, and shouting,
came to the startled ears of the invaders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twelve men will remain behind to guard the pinnaces,&rdquo;
cried Drake. &ldquo;The rest must follow me and
fight even to the last ditch. Forward!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Splitting into two bands, the Englishmen rushed
through the narrow streets with a wild cheer ringing
in the silent air. Drake&rsquo;s brother&mdash;with a certain
John Oxenham and sixteen others&mdash;hurried around
behind the King&rsquo;s treasure-house, and entered the
eastern side of the market-place; while Drake, himself,
marched up the main street with bugles blowing,
drums rolling, and balls of lighted tow blazing from
the end of long pikes carried by his stout retainers.
The townsfolk were terrified with the din and blaze
of fire. &ldquo;An army is upon us,&rdquo; cried many. &ldquo;We
must flee for our lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
In spite of this, a goodly number rallied at the
market-place, where there was a sharp fight. But
nothing could withstand the onset of the men from
the fog-swept island, and soon the Spaniards fled,
leaving two behind who had been captured and held.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must show us the Governor&rsquo;s house,&rdquo; cried
Drake. &ldquo;All the treasure is there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two captives obeyed unwillingly, and great was
the disappointment of the English when they found
only bars of silver in the spacious mansion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On! To the King&rsquo;s treasure-house!&rdquo; again
shouted the bold mariner. &ldquo;There, at least, must be
gold and jewels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact the English were furious with disappointment,
for, as they reached the Governor&rsquo;s mansion
(strongly built of lime and stone for the safe keeping
of treasure) the eager pillagers rushed through the
wide-open doorway. A candle stood lighted upon the
top of the stairs. Before the threshold a horse stood
champing his bit, as if recently saddled for the Governor,
himself, while, by the flickering gleam of the
taper, a huge glittering mass of silver bars was seen
piled from floor to ceiling. That was all,&mdash;no caskets
of gold or precious stones were to be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand to your weapons, men!&rdquo; cried Drake.
&ldquo;The town is full of people. Move carefully to the
King&rsquo;s treasure-house which is near the waterside.
There are more gold and jewels in that spot than all
our pinnaces can carry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the soldiers hurried where he led, a negro called
Diego, rushed panting from the direction of the shore.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
&ldquo;Marse Drake! Marse Drake!&rdquo; he wailed. &ldquo;De
boats am surrounded by de Spanish. Dey will sholy
be captured if you do not hurry back. Fo&rsquo; de Lohd&rsquo;s
sake, Massa, come down to de sho&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother and John Oxenham will hasten to the
shore,&rdquo; cried Drake. &ldquo;Meanwhile, my Hearties, come
batter down the doorway to this noble mansion. You
are at the mouth of the greatest treasure-chest in the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the valiant captain spoke these words, he stepped
forward to deal a blow, himself, at the stout door
which shut him from the glittering riches. But suddenly
he reeled and almost fell. Blood flowed in great
quantities upon the sand, from a wound in his leg
which he had received in the furious struggle within
the market-place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Captain,&rdquo; cried one of his retainers, seizing
him in his arms. &ldquo;You must hasten to our pinnaces.
What brooks this treasure to us when we lose you,
for, if you live we can secure gold and silver enough
at any time, but if you die we can find no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fear me that I am grievously hurt,&rdquo; sadly spake
the Captain. &ldquo;Give me but a drink and then I think
that I can reach our boats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A soldier stooped and bound his scarf about the
wounded leg of the now weakened leader, and, bearing
him aloft, the little band of adventurers turned
toward the ocean side. They soon embarked, with
many wounded besides the Captain, though none were
slain save one trumpeter.</p>

<p>Although the surgeons were kept busy in providing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
remedies and salves for the hurts of the soldiers, their
main care was for the bold Francis Drake,&mdash;leader
of this desperate expedition in quest of treasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we lose you,&rdquo; cried a sailor, &ldquo;we can scarce get
home again. But while we enjoy your presence and
have you in command of us, we can recover enough
of wealth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before we left the harbor we took, with little
trouble, a ship of wine for the greater comfort of our
company,&rdquo; writes one of the stout soldiers in this
brave affair. &ldquo;And though they shot at us from the
town we carried our prize to the Isle of Victuals.
Here we cured our wounded men and refreshed ourselves
in the goodly gardens which we found there
abounding with great store of dainty roots and fruit.
There were also great plenty of poultry and other
fowls, no less strange and delicate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although unsuccessful&mdash;as you see&mdash;the brave
mariners were not daunted, and, after the wounded
had recovered, a new expedition was determined upon,
with the purpose of capturing one of the trains of
mules which carried gold from Vera Cruz to Panama.
Drake had been joined by numerous Maroons&mdash;negroes
who had escaped from the Spaniards and
had turned bandits&mdash;and these were quite willing and
ready to aid him in the pursuit of treasure. But before
the English marauders moved towards the interior,
they attempted to attack Cartagena, the capital
of the Spanish Main.</p>

<p>Sailing into the harbor in front of this prosperous
town, one evening, they found that the townsfolk had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
been well warned of their coming; they rang their
bells and fired their cannon, while all of the soldiers
ranged themselves before the ramparts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egad,&rdquo; cried Drake, with strange cheerfulness, in
spite of his disappointment. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re far too ready
to receive us. We&rsquo;ve got to withdraw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they prowled around the mouth of the harbor,
captured two ships, outward bound, and roared with
laughter as they read a letter, written to warn all
nearby citizens of &ldquo;that terrible marauder, pirate, and
butcher, Captain Drake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Spaniards carry no treasure by land during
the rainy months,&rdquo; said one of the natives. &ldquo;You
must wait for five full moons, if you wish to catch a
mule train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Captain Drake. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fortify
a place of refuge&mdash;explore&mdash;and await the propitious
moment when we can hope for success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus they tarried patiently until they heard from
the Maroons (who ranged the country up and down)
that a large fleet had arrived from Spain at Nombre
de Dios. This was glad news. Drake smiled as he
heard it, and prepared immediately to make a land
journey to Panama with forty-eight followers, carrying
provisions, arms, and many pairs of shoes, because
they were to cross several rivers of stone and
gravel.</p>

<p>The way lay between great palm trees and through
cool and pleasant woods where the sturdy Englishmen
were much encouraged when they heard that there
stood a great tree, not far from where they were,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
from which one could see both the North Sea (Atlantic)
from which they were journeying, and the
South Sea (Pacific) towards which they were going.
Finally&mdash;upon the fourth day&mdash;they came to a very
steep hill, lying east and west like a ridge, and, at this
point, Pedro&mdash;chief of the Maroons&mdash;took Drake
by the hand, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me, O Captain, and I will show you two
seas at once, for you are in the very centre of this
country. Behold you stand in the heart of this fertile
land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Looking before him, the lion-hearted adventurer
saw a high tree in which had been cut many steps,
so that one could climb to the top. Here was a convenient
bower large enough for ten or twelve men to
seat themselves. Then&mdash;without further ado&mdash;he
and the chief Maroon clambered into the spreading
branches and gazed across the nodding palm tops
into the dim distance. It was a fair day, and, as the
Maroons had felled certain trees so that the prospect
might be more clear, upon the delighted vision of
the Englishman burst the vista of the blue Atlantic
and shimmering Pacific.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pray Almighty God in all his goodness,&rdquo; cried
out the adventurous Drake in loud tones of appreciation,
&ldquo;that I may have life and leave to sail but once
an English ship in this mighty ocean of the West!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he called up the rest of the voyagers, and
told them of his prayer and purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will follow you by God&rsquo;s grace!&rdquo; cried John
Oxenham, &ldquo;unless you do not wish my company.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
Drake smiled good-humoredly, and, with a wave
of his arm in the direction of the glistening waters,
descended to the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On, my hearties!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll soon bag
a mule train with its panniers filled with gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men started forward, singing an old English
ballad. As they walked through the high pampas
grass, they began to get glimpses of Panama and the
low-lying ships in the harbor. They kept silence and
at length hid themselves in a grove near the high road
from Panama to Nombre de Dios, while a negro was
sent into the city as a spy.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the faithful henchman returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A certain great man intends to go to Spain by
the first ship,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He is travelling towards
Nombre de Dios this very night with his daughter
and his family. He has fourteen mules, eight of
which are laden with gold and one with jewelry.
Two other trains of fifty mules each&mdash;burdened with
food and little silver&mdash;will also come up this night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The English smiled, and, without more ado,
marched to within two miles of Vera Cruz, where
half of them lay down upon one side of the road,
and half upon the other. They were screened by the
tall grass; so well, indeed, that no eye could see them,
and in an hour&rsquo;s time, to their eager ears came the
sound of mule trains passing to and fro near Vera
Cruz, where trade was lively because of the presence
of the Spanish fleet. All was propitious for a successful
attack.</p>

<p>But misfortune seemed always to follow the bold
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
and adventurous Drake. As mischance would have
it, one of his men called Robert Pike, who had &ldquo;drunk
too much brandy without water,&rdquo; was lying close to
the roadway by the side of a grinning Maroon, and,
when a well-mounted cavalier from Vera Cruz rode
by&mdash;with his page running at his stirrup&mdash;he rose
up to peer at him, even though his companion pulled
him down in the endeavor to hide his burly form.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sacre Nom de Dieu,&rdquo; cried the traveller. &ldquo;It
is a white man! An Englishman!&rdquo; and, putting
spurs to his horse, he rode away at a furious gallop
in order to warn others of the highwayman&rsquo;s position.</p>

<p>The ground was hard and the night was still. As
Captain Drake heard the gentleman&rsquo;s trot change into
a gallop, he uttered a round British oath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Discovered,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;but by whose fault
I know not. We&rsquo;ll await the other trains and mayhap
we&rsquo;ll have some booty yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gentleman, in fact, warned the Treasurer, who,
fearing that Captain Drake had wandered to this hidden
thicket, turned his train of mules aside and let
the others&mdash;who were behind him&mdash;pass on. Thus,
by recklessness of one of the company, a rich booty
was lost, but&mdash;as an Englishman has well said, &ldquo;We
thought that God would not let it be taken, for likely
it was well gotten by that Treasurer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no use repining, for soon a tinkling of
bells and tread of hoofs came to the eager ears of
the adventurers, and, through the long pampas grass
ambled the other two mule trains&mdash;their drivers
snapping the whips with little thought of the lurking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
danger. In a moment they were between the English
and hidden Maroons, who&mdash;with a wild cheer&mdash;dashed
upon them, surrounded them, and easily held
them in their power. Two horse loads of silver was
the prize for all this trouble and hard travel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never grieve over things past,&rdquo; cried Drake.
&ldquo;We must now march home by the shortest route.
It is certainly provoking that we lost the mule train
of gold, particularly as we were betrayed by one of
our own men. Come, soldiers, turn about and retreat
to our good ships.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half satisfied but cheerful, the soldiers and Maroons
turned towards the coast, and, as they neared
Vera Cruz, the infantrymen of the town swarmed
outside to attack the hated men of Merrie England,
with cries of, &ldquo;Surrender! Surrender!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drake looked at them scornfully, replying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Englishman never surrenders!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this a volley rang out and one of the intrepid
adventurers was &ldquo;so powdered with hail-shot that he
could not recover his life, although he continued all
that day with Drake&rsquo;s men.&rdquo; But stout Francis blew
his whistle&mdash;the signal for attack&mdash;and, with a wild
cry, the Maroons and English rushed for the black-haired
and sallow-skinned defenders of the town.
&ldquo;Yo Peho! Yo Peho!&rdquo; wailed the half-crazed natives
as they leaped high in the air, and encouraged
by the presence of the English, they broke through
the thickets at the town&rsquo;s end and forced the enemy
to fly, while the now terrified Spanish scurried pell
mell down the coast. Several of Drake&rsquo;s followers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
were wounded, and one Maroon was run through
with a pike, but his courage was so great that he
revenged his own death ere he died, by slaying a
Spaniard who opposed him.</p>

<p>At sunrise the land pirates continued their journey,
carrying some plunder from Vera Cruz. Some of the
men fainted with weakness, but two Maroons would
carry them along until they could again walk, and thus&mdash;struggling,
cursing and singing&mdash;the party of
weary and disappointed marauders neared the place
where they had left their ship. A messenger was sent
forward with a golden toothpick to those left behind
upon the vessel and a request that the ship be brought
into the narrow channel of a certain river. It was
done, and when at last the weary plunderers reached
the shore, they gave a mighty cheer as they saw the
white, bellying sails of their staunch, English vessel.
Their journey for pelf and jewels had been a
failure.</p>

<p>This did not discourage the lion-hearted Drake,
who declared, with a smile, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll yet catch a mule
train, boys, and one in which the panniers are filled
with sufficient gold to sink our good ship. Keep your
hearts bright and I&rsquo;ll gain you enough of treasure to
house you in peace and comfort in your old age.
Remember&mdash;&lsquo;Fortune favors the brave!&rsquo;&rdquo; He had
spoken with truth.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards a French captain appeared,
whose men were only too eager for a little journey
ashore after golden mule trains and battle. So a
party was made up of twenty Frenchmen, fifteen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
Englishmen, and some Maroons, who sailed with a frigate
and two pinnaces, towards a river called Rio Francisco&mdash;to
the west of Nombre de Dios. They landed,
struck inland, and were soon near the high road from
Panama to Nombre de Dios, where mule trains passed
daily&mdash;some with food and merchandise&mdash;a few
with golden ingots and bars of silver.</p>

<p>In silence they marched along and spent the night
about a mile from the road, where they could plainly
hear the carpenters working on their ships&mdash;which
they did at night because of the fierce, torrid sun during
the day. Next morning&mdash;the first of April, but
not an April Fool&rsquo;s day by any means&mdash;they heard
such a number of bells that the Maroons began
to chuckle and say, &ldquo;You will have much gold.
Yo Peho! Yo Peho! This time we will all be
rich!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly three mule trains came to view, one of
fifty long-eared beasts of burden; two of seventy each,
with every animal carrying three hundred pounds
weight of silver, amounting to nearly thirty tons. The
sight seemed almost too good to be true. With a wild
shout the ambuscaders leaped from their hiding places
to rush frantically upon the startled drivers. In a
few moments the train was in possession of Drake
and his French and half-negro associates, who chuckled
and grunted like peccaries.</p>

<p>The leading mules were taken by the heads and all
the rest lay down, as they always do when stopped.
The fifteen soldiers who guarded each train were
routed, but not before they had wounded the French
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
captain most severely and had slain one of the Maroons.
Silver bars and gold ingots were there aplenty.
They were seized and carried off, while, what was
not transported, was buried in the earthen burrows
made by the great land crabs under fallen trees, and
in the sand and gravel of a shallow river.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now for home,&rdquo; cried a valorous sea farer,
after a party had returned with a portion of the buried
treasure, which was divided equally between the
French and the English. Much of that left in the
sand crab holes had been discovered by the Spaniards&mdash;but
not all. Thirteen bars of silver and a few
quoits of gold had rewarded the search of the expectant
voyageurs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried all. &ldquo;Sails aloft for Merrie England!&rdquo;
So, spreading canvas, the bold adventurers
were soon headed for the foggy and misty isle from
which they had come. On Sunday, August ninth,
1573&mdash;just about sermon time&mdash;they dropped anchor
in the peaceful harbor of Plymouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the news of the Captain&rsquo;s return brought
unto his people, did so speedily pass over all the
church, and fill the minds of the congregation with
delight and desire to see him, that very few, or none,
remained with the preacher. All hastened to see the
evidence of God&rsquo;s love and blessing towards the gracious
Queen and country, by the fruit of the gallant
mariner&rsquo;s labor and success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To God alone,&rdquo; spake an humble citizen of Plymouth,
&ldquo;be the Glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">DRAKE&rsquo;S GREATEST VICTORY ON THE SPANISH MAIN.<br />
(The surrender of Don Anton to Sir Francis Drake, March 1, 1579.)</p>

<p>And all echoed these pious sentiments, in spite of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
the fact that Drake was a robber, a pirate, and a
buccaneer. But was he not their own countryman?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The scene now changes. It is a gray day at Plymouth
and anxious faces peer into the street from the
windows of the low, tiled houses. A crowd has collected
upon the jutting cliffs and all gaze with eager
eyes towards the ocean. Men speak in hushed and
subdued voices, for there is trouble in the air.</p>

<p>Among the knots of keen-eyed English there is one
small party which seems to be as joyous as a lot of
school-boys. Five men are playing at bowls, and one
of them is stout, and well knit, and swarthy visaged
with long exposure to the elements. He is laughing
uproariously, when a lean fellow comes running from
the very edge of those beetling cliffs which jut far out
into the gray, green Atlantic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark&rsquo;ee, Captain Drake!&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;Ships are
in the offing, and many of them too! It must be the
fleet of Philip of Spain come to ravage our beauteous
country!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, indeed,&rdquo; answers the staunch-figured captain,
without looking up. &ldquo;Then let me have one last shot,
I pray thee, before I go to meet them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so saying, he calmly tosses another ball
upon the greensward, knocks aside the wooden pins,
then smiling, turns and strides towards the waterside.</p>

<p>Thus Drake&mdash;the lion-hearted&mdash;goes out to battle
with the great Armada of Philip of Spain, with a
smile upon his lips, and full confidence in his ability
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
to defeat the Spaniards at home as well as on the
Spanish Main. Let us see how he fared?</p>

<p>Smarting with keen anger at Drake and his successful
attacks upon his western possessions, Philip&mdash;the
powerful monarch of Spain&mdash;determined to
gather a great fleet together and to invade England
with a mighty army.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That rascally pirate has beaten me at Cadiz, at
Cartagena, and at Lisbon,&rdquo; the irate king had roared,
with no show of composure. &ldquo;Now I will sail against
him and crush this buccaneer, so that he and his kind
can never rise again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A mighty fleet of heavy ships&mdash;the Armada&mdash;was
not ready to sail until July, 1588, and the months
before this had been well spent by the English in
preparation for defense, for they knew of the full
intention of their southern enemy. Shipwrights
worked day and night. The clamoring dockyards
hummed with excitement, while Good Queen Bess and
her Ministers of State wrote defiant letters to the
missives from the Spanish crown. The cold blood
of the English&mdash;always quite lukewarm in their
misty, moisty isle&mdash;had begun to boil with vigor.
The Britons would fight valiantly.</p>

<p>As the lumbering galleons neared the English coast,
a heavy mist which hid them, blew away, and the men
of England saw the glimmering water fairly black
with the wooden vultures of old Spain. The Spaniards
had come ready to fight in the way in which
they had won many a brilliant victory; with a horde
of towering hulks, of double-deckers and store-ships
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
manned by slaves and yellow-skinned retainers, who
despised big guns and loved a close encounter with
hand thrusts and push of pike. Like a huge, wooden
octopus this arrogant fleet of Arragon moved its tentacles
around the saucy, new-made pinnaces of the
tight little isle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boats of the English were very nimble and
of good steerage,&rdquo; writes a Spaniard, &ldquo;so that the
English did with them as they desired. And our
ships being very heavy compared with the lightness of
those of the enemy, it was impossible to come to hand-stroke
with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This tells the whole story. With a light wind astern&mdash;the
war ships of the English bore down easily upon
the heavy-bottomed Spanish galleons and fired their
guns at the hulls of the enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste your balls upon the rigging,&rdquo; cried
Drake through a trumpet. &ldquo;Sight low and sink &rsquo;em
if you can. But keep away from the grappling hooks
so&rsquo;s not to let &rsquo;em get hold of you. If they once do&mdash;you&rsquo;re
lost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now was the sound of splitting of boards, as the
solid shot pumped great holes in the sides of the high
rocking galleons. Dense clouds of vapor hung over
the struggling combatants&mdash;partly from a sea fog
which the July sun had not thoroughly burned away,
and partly from the spitting mouths of the cannon.
Fire burst from the decks, the roar of the guns was
intermingled with the shrill wails of the slaves, the
guttural cries of the seamen, the screams of the
wounded and the derisive howls of those maddened
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
by battle. The decks were crimson with blood; sails
split and tore as the chain-shot hummed through the
rigging, and the sharp twang of the arquebusques
was mingled with the crash of long-barrelled muskets.</p>

<p>No men can fight like those who are defending
their own homes. At Gettysburg, the Army of the
Potomac&mdash;twice beaten in an attack upon the South
in the enemy&rsquo;s country&mdash;struggled as it had never
done before,&mdash;and won. It had nowhere battled as
when the foe was pushing it back upon its own soil
and cities.</p>

<p>So here&mdash;no fighters ever bled as did the English
when the greedy hands of Spain were clutching at
their shores. The light ships hung near the Spaniards
at a distance and did not board until spars were
down and the great rakish hulls were part helpless.
Then&mdash;with a wild cheer&mdash;the little galleons&mdash;often
two at a time&mdash;would grapple with the enemy
and board&mdash;cutlasses swinging, pistols spitting, and
hand-spikes hewing a way through the struggling,
yellow-faced ruffians of Philip of Arragon.</p>

<p>While the awful battle raged, fire ships were prepared
on shore and sent down upon the Spanish fleet,
burning fiercely and painting the skyline with red.
Some of the large vessels had anchored, and, as these
terrors approached, they slipped their cables in order
to escape. Confusion beset the ranks of the boastful
foe and cheered on the British bull-dogs to renewed
exertions.</p>

<p>At six in the evening a mighty cry welled from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
British boats. &ldquo;They fly! They fly!&rdquo; sounded above
the ruck and roar of battle.</p>

<p>Yes&mdash;it was the truth. Beaten and dismayed, the
Spanish fleet bore away to the North, while the English&mdash;in
spite of the fact that their powder was wet,
and nearly all spent&mdash;&ldquo;gave them chase as if they
lacked nothing, until they had cleared their own coast
and some part of Scotland of them.&rdquo; The Armada&mdash;split,
part helpless&mdash;drifted away from Plymouth,
and wild cheers of joy came from the deck of the vessel
which carried bold Sir Francis Drake. The great
battle had been won.</p>

<p>So crippled were many of the Spanish hulks that
they were wrecked in stormy weather, off the coast
of Scotland and Ireland. Not half of those who put
to sea ever reached Spain again. Many sailors were
drowned, or perished miserably by the hands of the
natives of the coast, and some who escaped were put
to death by the Queen&rsquo;s orders. Fever and sickness
broke out in the English ships and the followers of
bold Drake died by hundreds, &ldquo;sickening one day and
perishing the next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The English vessels, themselves, were in a bad way&mdash;they
had to be disinfected and the men put ashore&mdash;where
the report of the many wrecks and the massacre
of Spanish soldiers, eased the anxiety of the
once terrified inhabitants of the tight little isle, and
made it certain that the Armada would never return.
Drake and his bold seamen had saved the people of
Merrie England. Again hats off to this pirate of the
Spanish Main!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
Safely settled in Buckland Abbey, knighted, honored,
respected&mdash;the hero of the defense of England&mdash;one
would think that Drake would have remained
peacefully at home to die &ldquo;with his boots on.&rdquo; But
not so. The spirit of adventure called to him with
irresistible force, and again he set out for the Spanish
Main. He had sailed around the world before his
grapple with the Armada; he had harassed the Spaniard
in an expedition to Lisbon; he was the idol of
the English. He had done enough&mdash;you say. Yes,
he had done enough&mdash;but&mdash;like all men who love
the game of life he wished to have just one more
expedition in search of gold and adventure, for&mdash;by
nature he was a gambler, and he was throwing the
dice with Fate.</p>

<p>So a goodly crew sailed with him again, hoping
for another raid upon mule trains and cities of treasure.
But alas! There was to be a different story
from the others. All the towns and hamlets of the
Spanish Main had been warned to &ldquo;be careful and
look well to themselves, for that Drake and Hawkins
were making ready in England to come upon them.&rdquo;
And when the English arrived they found stout defense
and valiant men, nor was a sail seen &ldquo;worth
giving chase unto.&rdquo; Hawkins died, many grew ill of
fever, and finally Drake, himself, succumbed to the
malarial atmosphere of Panama. He was to remain
where gold and adventure had first lured him.</p>

<p>On January the twenty-eighth, 1596, the great captain
yielded up his spirit &ldquo;like a Christian, quietly in
his cabin.&rdquo; And a league from the shore of Porto
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
Rico, the mighty rover of the seas was placed in a
weighted hammock and tossed into the sobbing ocean.
The spume frothed above the eddying current, sucked
downward by the emaciated form of the famous mariner,
and a solitary gull shrieked cruelly above the bubbles,
below which&mdash;upon beads of coral and clean
sand&mdash;rested the body of Sir Francis Drake, rover,
rogue, and rattling sea ranger. It was his last journey.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>OYS! You have all heard about the <em>Square
Deal</em>. Well&mdash;Here is the story of a man who
didn&rsquo;t get one.</p>

<p>Walter Raleigh was a brave man; he was an able
seafarer; his younger manhood was spent in the
midst of the most brilliant Royal Court which England
has known. He proved his courage and military prowess
in more than one bitterly contested battle-field and
naval conflict. His love of his own land and his hatred
of his enemies was ardent.</p>

<p>He was also a fellow of wit, and, as an author, took
rank with the great literary lights of the Elizabethan
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
Age. He was an adventurer, and, in middle life, as
well as in old age, braved the great deep and perils of
savage lands in the magnificent attempt to make discoveries
and to settle English colonies in the New
World. Chivalrous in actions and feeling; of handsome
person; graceful manners and courtly address;
it is no wonder that he had a host of enemies: those
fellows who couldn&rsquo;t do anything worth while themselves,
and wanted to &ldquo;pull the other fellow down.&rdquo;
There are plenty of them around, to-day, doing the
same thing in the same, old way.</p>

<p>As an Englishman he loved England to such an
extent, that&mdash;upon the return from one of his numerous
voyages&mdash;he dropped upon one knee and kissed
the sand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My men,&rdquo; said he to his followers, &ldquo;I love this
land as nothing else on earth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hostility of his rivals subjected him to harsh
ill treatment. It did not dampen his love for
England.</p>

<p>The silly caprices of Queen Elizabeth, who&mdash;like
most women&mdash;was swayed, not by her reason, but by
her sentiments, made him suffer imprisonment. Yet,
it did not dampen his love for England.</p>

<p>The terrible and bitter dislike of King James&mdash;who
succeeded the Virgin Queen&mdash;finally led to his trial
for treason; his execution; and his death.</p>

<p>Yet, it did not dampen his love for England.</p>

<p>If England can produce men of such a mold, nowadays,
she will continue to be a mighty world power.</p>

<p>Do you think that <em>you</em> could be as patriotic as Sir
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
Walter Raleigh? Particularly if <em>you</em> were treated as
<em>he</em> was treated? Think it over!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>One day, the ancient palace of Greenwich, which
stood on the banks of the Thames&mdash;a few miles below
London&mdash;presented a lively and brilliant scene.
Courtiers, arrayed in gorgeous colors and glittering
ornaments, walked about, chattering gaily,&mdash;like a
flock of sparrows. Fine, young cavaliers were there,
attired in rich velvets, sparkling with gems, armed with
gold-hilted swords. Grave statesmen wandered
around,&mdash;with beards as white as their ruffles.
Stately dames, with heavy and gaily trimmed trains,
peered at the beautiful belles, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, isn&rsquo;t she a fright!&rdquo; or</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness, what <em>dreadful</em> manners the Duchess
so-and-so has!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as they do to-day. Times do not change.</p>

<p>Trumpets blared a fan-fa-rade and lines of soldiers
gave forth inspiriting sounds, with many musical instruments.
There was a stir and flutter in the crowd;
and some one called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming! Hats off to the Queen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So all the men took off their hats,&mdash;for they were
courtiers, and it was their business to do so, whenever
Her Royal Highness came around. Many of them
didn&rsquo;t like to do it but if they hadn&rsquo;t done so, some
spy would have cried out &ldquo;Treason!&rdquo; And they
would have been hustled off to the Tower. You <em>just
bet</em> they took off their hats!</p>

<p>Descending the broad flight of steps, with proud
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
and majestic mien, the tall and slender figure of
Elizabeth&mdash;the maiden Queen of England&mdash;was
seen approaching.</p>

<p>She was then in the mature ripeness of middle age,
but she still preserved not a few remnants of the beauty
of her youth. Her form was straight and well proportioned.
Her large, blue eyes were yet bright and
expressive; her complexion was still wonderfully fair
and smooth. Her well arranged hair was luxuriant
and was of a light red. A large, fan-like collar of
richest lace rose from her slender neck, above her head
behind; and her tresses were combed high from her
forehead. Jewels blazed from her dress. Her attire
was far more splendid than that of any of the ladies
of her court.</p>

<p>As it happened, a heavy shower had just passed over,
and little puddles of water stood all around upon the
gravelled paths. Bursting through the fast-vanishing
clouds, the sun cast its rays upon the trees still dripping
with glittering drops; and upon the smiling Queen,
who&mdash;surrounded by a gay group of courtiers&mdash;set
forth upon a promenade through the park. She chatted
affably with all. They tried to make themselves as
agreeable as possible, for he who was most agreeable
received the best plums from the Royal Tree. Politics
haven&rsquo;t changed any since that day.</p>

<p>The Queen walked on, playing with a beautiful,
white greyhound, and, pretty soon she came to a muddy
spot in the path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zounds!&rdquo; said she (or it may have been something
stronger, for historians say that she could &ldquo;swear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
valiantly&rdquo;). &ldquo;Zounds! Now I will spoil my pretty
shoes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And also your pretty feet,&rdquo; interjected a courtier.
He received a smile for this compliment and the Queen
mentally made a note of it,&mdash;for future use in the
distribution of Court Favors.</p>

<p>She hesitated, looked around aimlessly, and stood
still.</p>

<p>At this instant a young noble&mdash;six feet tall and
elegantly attired&mdash;stepped forward; and, throwing
aside his richly embroidered cloak, spread it over the
muddy pool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prithee, pass onward!&rdquo; said he, bowing low.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was delighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Walter Raleigh,&rdquo; said she, smiling. &ldquo;You
are truly a gallant knight!&rdquo; And she tripped gaily
across the embroidered mantlet. &ldquo;I will reward you
right well for this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the courtiers, the Ladies, and the Statesmen
glanced with undisguised envy at the young gallant
who had so readily pleased their Mistress; and they
scowled at him as Elizabeth kept him at her side during
the rest of her promenade. &ldquo;The Beggar&rsquo;s outdone
us all!&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;Down with him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But they could not down Sir Walter just then.
After awhile they had &ldquo;their innings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rough, vain, whimsical Queen Bess was fond of
handsome, and especially of witty and eloquent young
men. She grew more attached to Sir Walter Raleigh
every day. He rapidly rose in power and influence,
and, as a poet, became well known. His verses were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
read in the luxurious halls of the palace with exclamations
of delight, while the tales of his military exploits
were eagerly repeated from mouth to mouth; for
Raleigh had fought valiantly in France and had helped
to suppress an insurrection in Ireland.</p>

<p>And still the jealous courtiers murmured among
themselves.</p>

<p>Raleigh was appointed &ldquo;Warden of the Stanneries,&rdquo;
or mines, in Cornwall and Devonshire, from which
he derived, each year, a large income. He was made
Captain of the Queen&rsquo;s Guard. He was created Lord
Lieutenant of Cornwall and Vice-Admiral of Devon.
He received vast estates in Ireland and many privileges
and licenses, so that he was fast becoming a rich man.
He was splendid and extravagant in his dress. He
grew arrogant. He had, in fact, &ldquo;too much Ego in his
Cosmos.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, the jealous courtiers continued to murmur
among themselves.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was fickle as well as sentimental. Her
fancy passed lightly from one gallant to another. For
some time Leicester (who had once been her sole
favorite, and who desired to regain his position) had
been growing jealous of Raleigh&rsquo;s ascendency; and
he had been delighted to see that Queen Bess had taken
a violent fancy to the impetuous Earl of Essex. A
quarrel took place between Raleigh and the Ruler
of England. He was affronted before the whole
court and retired to his chambers, overwhelmed with
grief.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">SIR WALTER RALEIGH.</p>

<p>And all the jealous courtiers punched each other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
beneath the ribs, and laughed &ldquo;Ha! Ha! Ha! What
did we tell you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took the &ldquo;Ego&rdquo; out of Raleigh&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cosmos.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the gallant courtier had a half-brother&mdash;Sir
Humphrey Gilbert&mdash;who had just returned from a
voyage around the world in the good ship <i>Golden
Hind</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s fit out a small fleet,&rdquo; said he to Raleigh,
&ldquo;and establish an English colony in Newfoundland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; cried Sir Walter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll found
another England in far distant America! On with
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus, an expedition of five ships sailed from Plymouth,
in the early summer of 1583. Sir Humphrey
boarded the <i>Squirrel</i>, and bade his kinsman an affectionate
adieu.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must remain behind,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and regain
our position at court!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will endeavor to do,&rdquo; answered Raleigh.
&ldquo;Good luck and God speed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The expedition was a failure from the start.
Scarcely had the shallops gone to sea, than one of them&mdash;the
<i>Raleigh</i>&mdash;deserted its companions and put
back. The rest reached Newfoundland, but the men
were lawless and insubordinate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the Deuce of a cold place for a colony,&rdquo;
they said. &ldquo;Home to Merrie England!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gilbert was forced to yield to their angry demands,
and re-embarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sail in that rattle-trap of a <i>Squirrel</i>,&rdquo; said
his officers to him. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll founder!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
But Sir Humphrey had that obstinacy which characterized
General Braddock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No: I will not forsake the little company, going
homeward,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick to my ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stuck&mdash;and&mdash;when they hailed him one stormy
night, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Be of good cheer, my friends: we are as near to
Heaven by sea as by land!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night the <i>Squirrel</i> was sailing a little in advance
of the other ships, and, as those on board the
<i>Golden Hind</i> watched the frail barque, they saw her
lurch, heave, and then sink from view. Thus the soul
of brave Raleigh&rsquo;s kinsman found a watery grave. He
had paid for his obstinacy with his life.</p>

<p>Raleigh was overwhelmed with grief when he
learned of the death of his heroic half-brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll yet found my Colony,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll go
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This pleased the jealous courtiers more than ever, for
they would now have him out of the way for all time.</p>

<p>With his ample wealth, the indefatigable adventurer
found no difficulty in fitting out an expedition, and, in
the year after the death of Sir Humphrey Gilbert, he
sent forth two vessels to explore the coast of the Carolinas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stay at home and face my enemies!&rdquo;
said the gay blade. &ldquo;Again good luck and God
Speed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had a fortunate voyage, and, when they returned,
the Captains told of the beautiful harbors, fine
rivers, magnificent forests and abundance of game.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
The Queen was delighted, and at once named the fair
country for herself, with characteristic egotism. That
men might know that this fruitful land was explored
in the time of the Virgin Queen, it was called &ldquo;Virginia.&rdquo;
Raleigh was wild with delight.</p>

<p>And the jealous courtiers looked dejected and sad.</p>

<p>A fleet of seven vessels&mdash;with one hundred colonists&mdash;was
now sent to Virginia, under the command of
one Grenville, who was eager to become suddenly rich:
a disease as common now as in those venturous days.
No sooner had the people landed, than they began to
treat the savages with such harshness and rapacity&mdash;that
they had to gain their own food, as the natives
would have nothing to do with them. Dissensions tore
the little community into shreds. So they were only
too glad to return with the gallant old sea-dog, Sir
Francis Drake, when he happened that way, with a
large amount of booty which he had just taken from
the Spaniards in the southern seas.</p>

<p>Another expedition was sent over by Raleigh; and
yet another. They were failures. But there was one,
single thing which was not a failure. This was the
discovery of a herb called &ldquo;Yppowoc,&rdquo; or tobacco, the
leaves of which&mdash;when dried&mdash;were smoked by the
natives in long pipes.</p>

<p>Curious Sir Walter had a jeweller in London make
him a silver pipe, after the fashion of those used by the
native Virginians. In this he began to smoke the
tobacco, and soon grew to like it very much; so much,
indeed, that he was scarcely ever without this comforter,
when enjoying the quiet of his home.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
One day he was sitting cosily by his fire with his
Long Nine in his mouth, and the smoke was curling
gracefully over his head. Just as he was puffing out
a particularly thick cloud, one of his servants happened
to enter the room with a tankard of ale, for the
luncheon table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye Gods!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;My Master&rsquo;s on fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Swash!!</em></p>

<p>Over Sir Walter&rsquo;s head went the ale, and the frightened
lackey dashed down the steps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;H-e-l-p! H-e-l-p!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;My Master is
burning up! H-e-l-p!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Sir Walter did not burn up this time. Instead
he near split his gallant sides with laughing.</p>

<p>Now, Boys, don&rsquo;t smile! &rsquo;Tis said that good old
Queen Bess tried, herself, to smoke a Long Nine. But&mdash;hush&mdash;&ldquo;she
became so dizzy and ill from the
effects that she never ventured upon the experiment
again!&rdquo; (Keep this quiet! Very quiet! Will you!)</p>

<p>On one occasion she was watching Sir Walter
blowing circles of smoke over his head, and said to
him&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zounds! (or something stronger) Sir Walter!
You are a witty man; but I will wager that you cannot
tell me the weight of the smoke which comes from
your pipe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can, indeed,&rdquo; was the confident reply of the gallant
courtier. &ldquo;Watch me closely!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At once he took as much tobacco as would fill his
pipe and exactly weighed it. Having then smoked it
up, he&mdash;in like manner&mdash;weighed the ashes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now, Your Majesty,&rdquo; said he, smiling. &ldquo;The difference
between these two weights is the weight of the
smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And again Queen Bess remarked &ldquo;Zounds!&rdquo; (or
Eftsoons!). At any rate, she paid the wager, for&mdash;with
all her frailties&mdash;she was a Good Loser.</p>

<p>Raleigh, in fact, shortly became reinstated in Royal
favor, and, when he aided Drake and Hawkins&mdash;soon
afterwards&mdash;in dispersing the Invincible Armada, he
was again in the good graces of his sovereign.</p>

<p>There was, however, a pretty, young Maid-of-Honor
at court, called Elizabeth Throgmorton, and no sooner
had the bright eyes of Sir Walter fallen upon her, than
he fell in love. In paying court to this amiable lady he
was compelled to use great caution and secrecy, for
jealous Queen Bess watched him narrowly, and with
suspicion. In spite of her preference for Essex, Elizabeth
was quite unwilling that Raleigh&mdash;her less
favored lover&mdash;should transfer his affections to another.
So, in making love to Elizabeth Throgmorton,
the gay courtier was compelled to use the utmost care.</p>

<p>But Murder (or Love) will out!</p>

<p>It chanced one day, that the Queen discovered what
was going on between her Maid-of-Honor and the
cavalier. Her rage knew no bounds. She berated
Raleigh before her ladies, and forbade him to come to
court. She fiercely commanded the Maid-of-Honor
to remain a prisoner in her room, and, on no account
to see Raleigh again. So the venturous Knight
turned his attention once more to wild roving upon the
sea.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
Now the jealous courtiers fairly chuckled with glee.
&ldquo;Ha! Ha! Ha!&rdquo; laughed they. &ldquo;Ho! Ho! Ho!
He! He! He!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Sir Walter engaged very actively in fitting out
some squadrons to attack the Spanish ships.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egad! I hate a Spaniard!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They are
my country&rsquo;s special enemies and I intend to do them
all the harm that I can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Queen was glad enough to separate him from
his lady love and not only consented to his project,
but promised to aid him in it. Ere long fifteen vessels
were anchored in the Thames&mdash;all ready to sail&mdash;but,
before he set out, the gallant commander made up
his mind that he would marry his beloved Maid-of-Honor.
It was not difficult to find a clergyman who
would splice him tighter than he ever spliced a rope
aboard ship. The deed was done. He set sail. All
was going propitiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attack the Spanish ships in the harbor of
Seville,&rdquo; said Raleigh. &ldquo;Then&mdash;off to the Spanish
Main and sack the town of Panama.&rdquo; He laughed,&mdash;but
what was that?</p>

<p>Rapidly approaching from the coast of England
came a swift pinnace. It gained upon the squadron
in spite of the fact that all sail was hoisted, and, at last
came near enough to give Raleigh a signal to &ldquo;Heave
to.&rdquo; In a few moments her commander climbed
aboard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Queen has changed her mind about your expedition,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;She has sent me&mdash;Sir Martin
Frobisher&mdash;to tell you to come home.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
Raleigh said things which made the air as blue as the
sea, but he put back&mdash;for he could not disobey the
Royal command. He was soon at court.</p>

<p>The Queen was furious with anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have disobeyed my commands,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I
find you have secretly married my Maid-of-Honor.
To the Tower with you! To the dungeons of the
Tower!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And all the jealous courtiers were so happy that
they danced a can-can in the ante chamber.</p>

<p>What do you think of this? Thrown into prison
because he loved a Maid and married her! Nowadays
&ldquo;all the World loves a Lover.&rdquo; In those times all
the world <em>might</em> have &ldquo;loved a Lover&rdquo; except Queen
Bess,&mdash;and a number of courtiers hanging around
within easy call: <em>They</em> kicked a Lover. And then they
all got together and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine! Fine! Now we&rsquo;ve got him where he ought
to be. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho! Ho!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But women relent; that is one of their chief characteristics.
Queen Bess softened, grew lukewarm,
finally became molten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir Walter Raleigh can go free,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>The gallant courtier returned to his country estate,
where&mdash;with his wife and children he enjoyed the
luxuries and comforts of country life. And the jealous
courtiers began to look strangely sober.</p>

<p>Still the sea called. The sea sang its old song, and,
fired with the spirit of adventure, Sir Walter decided
upon another expedition: this time to the coast of
Guiana, in South America, where, it was said, &ldquo;billets
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
of gold lay about in heaps, as if they were logs of
wood marked out to burn.&rdquo; With a large fleet at his
command he soon started upon this expedition for
plunder and for fame. This time no Sir Martin Frobisher
sailed after him to bring him back to a dungeon
in the Tower and he was able to reach his destination.</p>

<p>The expedition was a howling success. Whenever
and wherever Sir Walter could inflict injury on the
Spaniards, whom he so bitterly detested, he did so with
eagerness. A Spanish ship was soon seen, chased,
and&mdash;after a brief, hot fight&mdash;surrendered and was
boarded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egad!&rdquo; cried Raleigh. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck, for the
cargo&rsquo;s of fire arms. I&rsquo;ll stow them away in my own
vessel and let the captive go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Proceeding on his voyage, he not long afterwards
encountered and captured another prize; a Flemish
ship sailing homeward with a cargo of fine wine.
Twenty hogsheads were transferred to the hold of
Raleigh&rsquo;s ship and the captured craft was allowed to
sail on,&mdash;empty.</p>

<p>Things continued to go well. The Island of Trinidad
(off Venezuela) was reached at last. The natives
were friendly and told of vast deposits of gold far up
the river Orinoco. &ldquo;But would Raleigh not please
besiege the Spanish town of St. Joseph?&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;and rescue some of their chiefs whom the Spaniards
held prisoners&mdash;in chains.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always strike a Spaniard when I can,&rdquo; said
Raleigh. &ldquo;On, men, we&rsquo;ll sack this proud city!&rdquo;</p>

<p>St. Joseph speedily fell into his hands. The chiefs
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
were released. They were so gratified, that they
paddled him far up the river, where they found glittering
gold, which they tore out of rocks with their
daggers. The Englishmen were delighted, and, collecting
a mass of nuggets to show to those at home,
they put back to the ships, set sail, and were soon in
England again.</p>

<p>The people were astonished at this exploit, but the
jealous courtiers did all they could to deprive Raleigh
of the renown which was justly his due.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What this fellow has told is a lie,&rdquo; whispered they
into the ears of good Queen Bess. &ldquo;There is no
such place as Guiana. Raleigh has been down upon
the coast of Spain and hidden himself. He has not
crossed the Atlantic at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which proves that no one can ever do anything
adventurous without stirring up the hammers of the
Envious: the Little Men. Is it not so to-day? Look
around! You can hear the carping critic at any time
that you may wish! <em>Do</em> something <em>big</em>, sometime.
Then put your ear to the ground and listen!</p>

<p>But the sea called for the fifth time. A vast English
fleet was hurled against the Spanish at Cadiz,&mdash;a
great English fleet, accompanied by an army. England
was bound to get even with the Spaniards for
daring to launch the supposedly invincible Armada
against them&mdash;and Sir Walter eagerly sailed for the
coast of Spain.</p>

<p>The harbor of Cadiz was seen to be fairly jammed
full of stately galleons and men-of-war. Arranged in
compact rows, close to shore, just below the towering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
and frowning castle of Cadiz; they were protected,
on either side, by fortresses, whence heavy guns peeped
forth to defend them. There were nearly sixty large
vessels in all, four of which were galleons, and twenty
of which were galleys: well-manned and well-armed
with small cannon. There were many more ships than
in the attacking fleet.</p>

<p>It was the evening of June the 20th, 1596. The
British vessels rapidly sailed into the harbor, Raleigh
leading, in the flagship, the <i>Water Sprite</i>; behind him
the <i>Mary Rose</i>, commanded by his cousin, Sir George
Carew; and the <i>Rainbow</i> under Sir Francis Vere.
All were eager for the fray, and it was not long before
their approach was observed by the Spanish fleet. Instantly
a huge galleon, the <i>Saint Philip</i>&mdash;the largest
in the Spanish Navy&mdash;swung out of her position, followed
by the <i>Saint Andrew</i>, second only to her in size.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming to meet me!&rdquo; cried Raleigh&mdash;joyously.</p>

<p>Instead of that, the galleons sailed for a narrow
strait in the harbor&mdash;followed by the rest of the
Spanish fleet&mdash;and cast anchor just under the stout
fortress of Puntal. They arranged themselves in close
array and awaited the attack of the English.</p>

<p>The English fleet anchored, but at daybreak, the
impetuous Raleigh bore down upon the formidable
mass of hulking galleons. The sun rays streamed
over the old, Spanish town, gilding the pinnaces and
spires of the churches, shining brightly upon the flapping
pennons of Britisher and Don. The white sails
flapped, spars creaked and groaned, the sailors cheered,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
and&mdash;in a moment&mdash;the cannon began to bark, like
wolf hounds. The fight had begun.</p>

<p>Raleigh was the incarnation of battle. Passing
rapidly from point to point upon the deck of his vessel,
he encouraged and urged on his men, exposed himself
as freely as the rest; and whenever a man faltered,
there he appeared to urge the faint heart on with words
of inspiration and hope.</p>

<p><em>Roar! Roar! Roar! Zoom! Zoom! Crash!</em></p>

<p>The arquebusses spittled and spat; cannon growled;
and iron crashed into solid oak planking.</p>

<p>The orders were not to board until the fly-boats
(long, flat-bottomed vessels with high sterns) came
up, which were manned by Dutch allies. For three
hours the battle raged, but the fly-boats did not arrive.
The Earl of Essex&mdash;the commander of this expedition&mdash;now
ordered his flagship to pass through the
advance line of vessels, and make the way to the front.
Raleigh was chafing with rage because the fly-boats
did not come, yet, in spite of the danger of being shot,
he jumped into a light skiff, and was rowed over to
the galleon of Essex.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll board the <i>Saint Philip</i>,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;if the fly-boats
do not soon arrive. Even though it be against
the orders of the Admiral. For it is the same loss to
burn, or to sink, and I must soon endure one or the
other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead!&rdquo; yelled Essex, over the bow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
second you, upon my honor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raleigh hastened with all speed to the deck of the
<i>Water Sprite</i>, where his men were pounding away at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
the Spanish galleons with all their might and main.
No sooner had he mounted the poop, than he saw, with
anger, that two vessels of his own squadron had forced
themselves into a position in front of his own; for
their commanders wanted to win first honors in this
battle at sea.</p>

<p>Raleigh, himself, wished to have the honor, just like
other sea captains in later battles. But,&mdash;that&rsquo;s another
story.</p>

<p>So, the gallant seaman ran the <i>Water Sprite</i> between
the two other ships and took up his position as leader.
Sir Francis Vere of the <i>Rainbow</i> was resolved to keep
in front as well as Raleigh.</p>

<p>As the <i>Water Sprite</i> passed him he slyly cast a rope
to a sailor, who tied it to her stern, and his own vessel
thus kept abreast of the lumbering galley of his
chief. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; writes Sir Walter, &ldquo;some of my company
advising me thereof, I caused the rope to be cast
off, and so Vere fell back in his place, where I guarded
him&mdash;all but his very prow&mdash;from the sight of the
enemy. I was very sure that none would outstart me
again for that day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The guns of the fort appeared to be silent and the
big galleons lay apparently helpless in the face of the
valiant enemy. Raleigh moved on, but, as he was
about to clutch his splendid prize, it escaped him, for
the Spaniards&mdash;finding that they would be captured&mdash;made
haste to run the <i>Saint Philip</i>, and several of
her sister ships, aground on the sand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blow them up!&rdquo; came the order.</p>

<p>The Spanish sailors and soldiers came tumbling out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
of the ships into the sea in heaps&mdash;&ldquo;as thick as if
coals had been poured out of a sack into many pots at
once.&rdquo; Then a terrific roar boomed forth. The air
was filled with flying splinters, canvas, iron, and lead.
The portions of the galleons were now floating upon
the waves and the water was alive with the struggling
bodies of the Spaniards as they desperately endeavored
to save themselves.</p>

<p>The spectacle was lamentable. Many drowned themselves.
Many, half burned, leaped into the water;
while others hung by the ropes&rsquo; ends; by the ships&rsquo;
sides; under the sea, even to their lips. &ldquo;If any man
had a desire to see Hell, itself,&rdquo; wrote Sir Walter, &ldquo;it
was there most lively figured!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!</p>

<p>The English sailors were cheering, for victory was
theirs, and of all the gallant warriors of that day,
Raleigh had been the most persistently daring and
heroic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Saint Andrew</i>&rsquo;s still afloat, good Sire!&rdquo; cried
one of his sailors at this moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll take her!&rdquo; cried Raleigh.</p>

<p>She was boarded and captured with little difficulty,
while yet another galleon&mdash;the <i>Saint Matthew</i>&mdash;fell
into his hands. These were the only vessels of all that
proud Spanish fleet which had escaped the flames.</p>

<p>Raleigh, himself, had been severely wounded in the
leg, but he refused to release the command of his ship.
He gave orders that all lives should be spared, and
although these mandates were rigidly obeyed by the
English soldiers, the Dutch cruelly slaughtered many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
of their hapless prisoners, for their hatred of the
Spaniards was bitter and savage.</p>

<p>Cadiz had not yet fallen and Raleigh was determined
to go on shore with the troops and witness the taking
of the town, in spite of his wound. A litter was prepared
for him&mdash;he was lowered into one of the boats&mdash;rowed
ashore, carried upon the shoulders of some of
his faithful soldiers, and witnessed the furious struggle
which now ensued. Cadiz fell. Although the lives
of the people were spared; the castle, fortifications and
the greater part of the town itself, were burned and
demolished. If you go there, to-day, you will still
find the marks of this great and stirring strife.</p>

<p>There was nothing left but to put the Spanish prisoners
aboard the galleons, collect the plunder, and set
sail for England. When the fleet again swung into the
little harbor of Plymouth it was received by the people
with wildest enthusiasm and delight. All England
rang with the praise of the valor and courage of her
heroes, for Spain had been stripped of her ability to
injure her English rival and England&rsquo;s power was
supreme upon the sea. Raleigh and his comrades had
done this,&mdash;and the descendants of Raleigh and his
comrades have continued to uphold the supremacy.
Hurrah for Raleigh!</p>

<p>But how about those jealous courtiers? They were
still around&mdash;Oh, yes!&mdash;And Raleigh was greeted
at court as coldly as when he had departed with the
fleet. He had been deprived of his office of Captain
of the Queen&rsquo;s Guard, and even his bravery at Cadiz
did not win this back for him. Nor did he receive any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
of the spoil which had been won by himself and his
comrades. Even Queen Bess was angry because her
share of the booty taken from Cadiz was not as great
as she had hoped for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the Generals have got,&rdquo; wrote Sir Walter,
&ldquo;I know least. For my own part, I have got a game
leg, and am deformed. I have received many good
words and exceedingly kind and regardful usage; but
I have possession of naught but poverty and pain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not long afterwards the old Queen was persuaded
to write Sir Walter to come to court, and thus he
and his wife, whom Elizabeth had also forgiven, appeared
daily in the brilliant throng which clustered in
the halls and corridors of the Royal Palace. He was
restored to his old office of Captain of the Queen&rsquo;s
Guard and rode forth again in all the splendor of his
uniform, at the side of the sovereign.</p>

<p>The rest of Sir Walter&rsquo;s life can be briefly narrated.
With Essex he took part in a successful expedition to
the Azores, where they captured many ships, and with
him divided much booty and fame. But Essex became
too ambitious and started a conspiracy to place himself
upon the throne of England. It was a failure. He
was captured by the Queen&rsquo;s soldiers&mdash;a part under
Sir Walter himself&mdash;was tried, and executed for High
Treason.</p>

<p>Queen Bess soon died and was succeeded by a man
who disliked Sir Walter from the start. This was
James the First of Scotland&mdash;a &ldquo;dour&rdquo; fellow&mdash;who
charged the valorous knight with treason, for it
was alleged that he had conspired, with Lord Cobham,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
to place the youthful Arabella Stuart upon the throne.
He was tried, convicted, and thrown into the Tower,
where he lived for twelve long, tedious years. Think
of it! A fellow of his venturesome and restless spirit
forced to remain in a dungeon-keep for such a time!
Weep for brave Sir Walter! This was fine treatment
for a patriot!</p>

<p>But the jealous courtiers did not weep. Oh no!
<em>They</em> laughed.</p>

<p>When gallant Sir Walter was thrown into the Tower
(for he had not plotted against the King) he was a
hale and stalwart cavalier of fifty-two. He was released&mdash;after
twelve years&mdash;when his hair and beard
were grizzled, his face worn and wrinkled, his body
somewhat bent, and his features grave and sorrowful.
With what tearful joy he clasped to his breast his ever
faithful wife and his two sons! At sixty-four his
brave spirit was still unshaken; his ardent and restless
ambition was as keen as ever.</p>

<p>He went forth with the sentence of death still hanging
over his head; for King James, although giving
a grudging consent to his release, had refused to pardon
him. And he went forth with the understanding
that he should lead an expedition to the coast of Guiana
in South America; there to attack the Spaniards and
gain plunder, gold, and jewels. If successful he was
to go free. If non-successful, he was to suffer punishment&mdash;perhaps
death!</p>

<p>The expedition was a failure. The Spaniards and
natives were well aware of his coming, for &rsquo;tis said that
King James, himself, sent them news of the expedition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
&ldquo;If I go home it&rsquo;s off with my head,&rdquo; said Sir Walter.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll risk it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t you think if you had been Sir Walter, instead
of sailing to England where you knew that a headsman&rsquo;s
axe awaited you, you would have coasted by
the shores of the Chesapeake Bay and dropped off
quietly where is the home of the canvas-back and the
terrapin! Just stepped into one of the jolly-boats and
peacefully drifted ashore on a dark night?</p>

<p>I think that you would have been strongly inclined
to do so,&mdash;but <em>you</em> are not Sir Walter Raleigh. <em>He</em>
was a lion-hearted adventurer.</p>

<p>Opportunity after opportunity came to him to escape
to the shores of France. He let them go by, but, when
he found that his enemies demanded his trial for
treason, he thought it high time to get away. He
learned that a French envoy had arranged to get him to
France and had a barque for this purpose. A certain
Captain King had found a small boat commanded by
one of Sir Walter&rsquo;s old boatmen, which lay at Tilbury
awaiting his orders. It was arranged by Raleigh&rsquo;s
guard&mdash;one Stukeley&mdash;that he should be rowed to
the little lugger on the evening of Sunday, August the
9th, 1618. The latter was sent up the Thames river
to Gravesend.</p>

<p>At the hour designated, Raleigh, Captain King,
Stukeley and his son Hart, with a page, jumped into
two small wherries in order to row to the lugger. They
had just shoved off, when keen Sir Walter saw another
boat push out from the bank and follow them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said he to Stukeley.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
But silent Stukeley did not answer.</p>

<p>The boat rowed fast, but the pursuing craft moved
with equal speed. The tide was singing and gurgling
in a mad flow, and it became doubtful whether the
wherries could reach Gravesend under the protection
of darkness, for day was breaking, and the whirling
water made progress very slow.</p>

<p>At last&mdash;seeing that they could not get away&mdash;the
shallops were forced to turn about and retrace
their passage. The pursuing boat swung, also&mdash;like
a shadow of the first. Sir Walter&rsquo;s heart beat tumultuously.</p>

<p>When the fugitives reached Greenwich&mdash;Stukeley
stood up and appeared in his true colors. Laying a
hand upon the shoulder of faithful Captain King, he
cried&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I arrest you in the name of our Monarch, James
First!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Raleigh looked around in anger and dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stukeley,&rdquo; he said with heat, &ldquo;you are a trait&rsquo;rous
cur. These actions will not turn out to your credit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the knave laughed derisively,&mdash;so derisively
that the common people dubbed him &ldquo;Sir Judas
Stukeley.&rdquo; And it well suited him. Didn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>The boatmen rowed directly to the Tower and the
boat which had pursued the wherries&mdash;which contained
a courtier named Herbert (to whom Stukeley
had betrayed the projected escape)&mdash;followed them
close. The soldiers in her (for they had been well
hidden) escorted the dejected Sir Walter to the grim
walls of the dungeon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
There was now no hope for that gallant adventurer:
the man had brought honor and renown to England.
He was tried for Treason: condemned: executed.</p>

<p>As he stood waiting for the axe to fall, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have many sins for which to beseech God&rsquo;s
pardon. For a long time my course was a course of
vanity. I have been a seafaring man, a soldier, and
a courtier; and, in the temptations of the least of
these there is enough to overthrow a good mind and
a good man. I die in the faith professed by the Church
of England. I hope to be saved, and to have my sins
washed away by the precious blood and merits of our
Saviour, Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A quick shudder ran through the multitude when
Sir Walter had ceased to live, and many groaned aloud
at the horrible sight. One stout yeoman cried out
angrily, &ldquo;We have not had such another head to be
cut off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crowd separated slowly, muttering and crying
out against the enemies of the valiant man; while his
friends, who were present, parted with tears coursing
down their cheeks.</p>

<p>And the jealous courtiers said: &ldquo;Magnificent!&rdquo; It
was now their turn to shout. And they did it, too.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>So, you see, Sir Walter Raleigh&rsquo;s patriotism was
paid for by death. The trouble with him was, he
was too much of a man.</p>

<p><em>Nowadays</em>&mdash;when a soldier or sailor does something
for England&mdash;they give him a Hip! Hip!
Hurray!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
He is appreciated. He is presented with titles,
honors, and a warm reception.</p>

<p><em>Then</em>, when a man did something for England, those
in power gave him the cold shoulder; the icy stare.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the reason why England&rsquo;s sons will do something
for her now. If she had kept treating them as
she did Sir Walter Raleigh she wouldn&rsquo;t have many
of them around when it came to a fight. <em>And, some
day, she&rsquo;ll need them all!</em></p>

<p>So when a fellow does something really great, don&rsquo;t
greet him with frozen silence. <em>Cheer! He needs it!
Besides,&mdash;it won&rsquo;t hurt you!</em></p>

<p><em>Give a tiger and three times three!</em></p>

<p class="author">&mdash;<i>Rhymes of The Dutch Channel Fleet.</i>&mdash;1676.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE good ship <i>Cochon Gras</i> boiled along off the
coast of Normandy under a full spread of
canvas, for the breeze was light, and was from
the southward. A boy of sixteen stood at the helm.
He was well bronzed by exposure to the elements;
was sturdy and strong. His dark hair waved luxuriantly
about a face in which keenness and shrewdness
were easily to be seen. His name was Jean Bart and
he had been born at Dunkirk in France.</p>

<p>The Captain of the <i>Cochon Gras</i> strode about upon
the deck below. He was in an evil mood and his
voice showed his ill feeling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put the helm over!&rdquo; he shouted to the steersman.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that your sails aren&rsquo;t half full! Boy,
will you never learn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean Bart obeyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, my Captain!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Very good,
my Monsieur Valbu&eacute;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, at this, the captain scowled, for he was in a
beastly temper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad that you act quickly,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You
know nothing. By acting quickly you will learn a
thing or two. <em>Tiens!</em> Be speedy! Be very quick!
Be like the Bishop of Ol&eacute;ron!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled and lurched against the rail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, this good prelate was a true seaman,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;He knew the tides like a mackerel. He knew as
much as I do, myself, and that is saying a good deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean Bart chuckled at the vanity of Monsieur
Valbu&eacute;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The good Bishop was standing on the rocks upon
a stormy evening,&rdquo; continued the captain, &ldquo;when
he saw some fisher boats making for the harbor. One
of them was bearing too close to the shore. One of
them was going to go upon the rocks. One of them
was steered by a poor fellow who knew neither the
reefs nor the shoals. &lsquo;Voil&agrave;!&rsquo; cried the good bishop.
&lsquo;Voil&agrave;! I will save this dull-witted sailor.&rsquo; And,
forthwith, what do you think that he did,&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A small knot of seamen had, by this time, collected
around the talkative captain. They all shook their
heads.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">JEAN BART.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fools,&rdquo; cried Captain Valbu&eacute;. &ldquo;Fools! Why,
he strode into the sea, of course. Being a pure man
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
of God and a member of the true church, he walked
upon the surface of the water. The boat coming in
was manned by Huguenots, by unbelievers, mark
you! By fellows who had neither the sense nor the
grace to be members of the true church. <em>They</em> could
not walk upon the water. Oh! No! But the good
Bishop <em>he</em> walked as easily as a stormy petrel, for he
was a man of God. And, as he reached the boat he
made the sign of the cross, saying, &lsquo;Beware of the
rocks which you sail down upon! Bear off to the
left! When you see the red buoy, bear to the right,
and then come home by keeping your bow pointed for
the spire of the big church!&rsquo; And they did so. They
were saved by the good Bishop, whom I know well.
As for me. I would have let the foolish Huguenots
get their just deserts. It would have been one heretic
less and good riddance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this one of the seamen was plainly angered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Piff!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Piff!&rdquo; That was all. But
Monsieur Valbu&eacute; had noticed it and Monsieur Valbu&eacute;
grew angry in a moment. Seizing a half-empty cider
mug, from which he had been drinking, he hurled it
at the head of the fellow who had made the remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You dog of a Huguenot!&rdquo; he roared.</p>

<p>The seaman dodged, and the cider mug spun into
the planks of a jolly boat. Then he stepped forward
and said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Valbu&eacute;, the Laws of Ol&eacute;ron, under which
we sail, say that you cannot and must not strike a
seaman with any missile. I, Lanoix, will strike back
if you hit me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
But Monsieur Valbu&eacute; was like a bubbling tea-pot.
Seizing a hand-spike, he shot it out at the man who
knew the law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Laws of Ol&eacute;ron allow me just one blow,&rdquo;
blubbered Captain Valbu&eacute;. &ldquo;Just as the laws of
England allow each dog one bite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As luck would have it, he missed his shot.</p>

<p>Lanoix leaped over the iron rail which separated
the forecastle from the after part of the vessel. Then
he turned around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me here, you coward!&rdquo; he shouted to the
captain, &ldquo;and I will have the right to crack you
through the middle. Consult the Laws of Ol&eacute;ron under
which we sail and see if they do not back me up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The laws be blowed!&rdquo; yelled Monsieur Valbu&eacute;,
now beside himself with rage. And, leaping across
the rail he struck the Huguenot two sturdy blows in
the face.</p>

<p>Jean Bart, meanwhile, steered the ship: looked on;
and said nothing.</p>

<p>R-i-i-p! There was a flash, a blow, and a cry of
pain. A large, keen knife was clenched in the strong
right hand of Lanoix, and the captain was running
red, with a deep gash in his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down with the Mutineer! Down with the dog!&rdquo;
came from the throats of the members of the crew
who had clustered about the two enraged men, smiling
at the little affair.</p>

<p>With a rush they were upon the Huguenot; had
forced him to the deck; and wrested the knife from
his hand. But, before it was wrenched from his fist,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
the blade had pierced the body of a seaman and had
felled him to the boarding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring up the Laws of Ol&eacute;ron,&rdquo; cried Captain
Valbu&eacute;, when the Huguenot had been secured.
&ldquo;Bring up the Laws of Ol&eacute;ron from my cabin, and
let us see whether or no I was right, when I struck
this prating Lanoix!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cabin-boy dove below and was soon again upon
the deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The law shall be read,&rdquo; cried the captain. &ldquo;Out
with it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, aboard the vessel was one Antoine Sauret&mdash;a
good, old boatswain&mdash;a friend of the father of
Jean Bart, and a courageous man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The law shows you to be in the wrong,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Jean Bart from the wheel, which he
had not left. &ldquo;You were, and are, in the wrong.&rdquo;
Monsieur Valbu&eacute; glowered at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the law,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Is this not my vessel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the right is on his side,&rdquo; interrupted the good
Antoine Sauret.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wait and see what I do to this cur of a
Huguenot,&rdquo; snarled Captain Valbu&eacute;. &ldquo;And no more
talk from either you or Jean Bart. Hear! Six out
of eight of the crew agree that this Lanoix has
wounded me and has slain one of his ship-mates&mdash;without
proper provocation&mdash;I will now fix him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this he did in the most approved manner.</p>

<p>Lashing his victim&rsquo;s arm to a sharp sword tied to
the windlass, he knocked the unfortunate Lanoix
upon the deck with a hand-spike. Then, tying him&mdash;still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
alive&mdash;to the dead sailor whom the Huguenot
had killed when the crew rushed upon him,&mdash;he cried
out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw &rsquo;em both to the fishes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were seized.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One! Two! Three! Heave Away!&rdquo; sounded
from the throats of the Frenchmen.</p>

<p>Lanoix and the dead sailor spun out above the blue
water. A splash. A gurgle of white foam, and the
Atlantic closed above them.</p>

<p>Seamen&mdash;you witness&mdash;were brutes, in these
merry days of privateering. But hear the sequel of
the gruesome story!</p>

<p>Jean Bart and the good boatswain Sauret had, from
that moment, no high opinion of the Laws of Ol&eacute;ron.
So, when the vessel touched at Calais, upon the coast
of France, they walked up to the captain, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir. We wish to leave you! We cannot sail any
longer beneath your orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brutal Valbu&eacute; scowled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And good riddance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when the circumstances of the death of the two
men were reported to the authorities, the captain was
tried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Law of Ol&eacute;ron,&rdquo; said the Judge to him,
&ldquo;acquits you, for the Huguenot sailor was in the
wrong to draw his knife, when you struck him only
with your fists. But it is a bad law and must be
changed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here he turned to young Jean Bart and the good
Sauret.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
&ldquo;As for you two,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I most highly commend
you for protesting against the brutality of this
captain. Would that all the sailors of France were
as good as both of you. If they were, there would
be less trouble aboard ship. Again I commend you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So&mdash;feeling very happy, indeed&mdash;young Jean
Bart went out into the street. Though only sixteen
he had been right in his attempt to save the life of
poor Lanoix. Good for young Bart! Hats off to
the sailor lad of sixteen who was more merciful than
the cruel Law of Ol&eacute;ron! And this brutal set of rules
was soon changed to the Maritime Code of France,
which gave seamen some right to defend themselves
against the attacks of rough and overbearing captains.
Thus Jean Bart had started the ball rolling in the right
direction. Again hats off to the doughty, young
Frenchman!</p>

<p>Not long after this event the Dutch fell out with
the English and began a smart little war. Jean Bart
hastened to the scene of action, enrolled in the Dutch
cause, and fought with them for five full years. Then
the Dutch began to make war upon the French (in
1672), but this was too much for the patriotic sentiments
of the youthful volunteer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;When my own people are attacked,
I must hasten to their assistance. The Dutch
have paid me well &rsquo;tis true, but now I scorn their gold.
Vive la France!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he returned to Dunkirk, speedily found
employment, and went to sea again&mdash;not in a man-of-war,
but in a privateer. He was now four-and-twenty;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
was wiry, tough, and well used to battling
both with men and with the elements. The boat he
sailed in mounted only two guns and had a crew of
thirty-six. She was named after a famous personage
of Biblical history: <i>King David</i>, and she conducted
herself as skilfully as did that ancient monarch, for
was not Jean Bart at the helm?</p>

<p>Cruising out upon the treacherous waters of the
North Sea, it was not long before a vessel was sighted
that was of such small tonnage that Bart was not
afraid to give chase. He slapped on all canvas, put
his helm hard over, and steered for the dancing bit of
canvas. The <i>King David</i> was a swift sailer, and soon
the bow-gun spoke from the deck of the French privateer,
sending a challenging shot whistling close to
the stern of the stranger, who flew the flag of the
States General (the Dutch Republic) with which the
French were now at war.</p>

<p>The stranger did not relish the challenge, and came
to in a hurry, while her flag fluttered weakly to the
deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s ours!&rdquo; cried Jean Bart, gleefully. &ldquo;And
without a fight. Hurray for the life of a privateer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quickly ranging alongside, the stranger was seen
to be a valuable prize, laden with tea, spices, and cotton.
She was manned by a small crew and sent to
port.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now off for other luck!&rdquo; cried Jean Bart.</p>

<p>Luck was with him, too. In four months cruising
in the English Channel, near the Belgian coast, he captured
six prizes; all without any fighting. The Dutch
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
trading vessels of those days must have been without
guns and poorly manned, for it should have been easy
to stand off a crew of but thirty-six, with only two
cannon aboard. Jean Bart&mdash;you may be sure&mdash;was
well satisfied. He was now rich, quite famous, and
keen for further adventure.</p>

<p>So well did the owners of the privateer <i>King David</i>
think of him, that they now put him in charge of a
larger vessel named <i>La Royale</i>, carrying about eighty
men and ten guns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go out and win!&rdquo; cried the chief owner of this
privateer. &ldquo;Jean Bart, you are followed by the best
blood of France. Your men are all from Dunkirk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Jean Bart smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch me!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Cruising near the coast of Holland in company
with a small French gun-boat, he fell in with a man-of-war&mdash;the
<i>Esperance</i>&mdash;carrying twelve guns and
about one hundred and twenty men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll have a real fight!&rdquo; cried the youthful
French commander as he cleared decks for action.
&ldquo;Men, see to it that your swords are sharpened for
there may be some boarding!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he signalled to the little French gun-boat to
follow him and give battle. This ally carried about
a hundred men and six cannon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poof! Poof!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The heavy guns of the Dutchman were the first to
speak and they barked away like fat Newfoundland
watch-dogs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poof! Poof! B-o-o-m!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
Jean Bart reserved his fire until within about
seventy-five yards and then he gave the command,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire away! Aim low! And try to hull her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sheet of flame sprang from the ten guns of <i>La
Royale</i> and a splitting of boards and crackling of
splinters showed that the iron missiles had punctured
the stout sides of the <i>Esperance</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pop! Pop! Crash!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other French vessel now threw her lead into
the stern of the defender of the flag of the States General
and her mizzen-mast was seen to rock like an
unfastened May pole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Esperance</i> was not slow in answering back and
her twelve guns spat like leopards in the brush. She
filled away and bore towards the land, but the French
gun-boat saw this move and checkmated it.</p>

<p>Sailing across her bow, the Frenchman raked her
fore and aft, while the rub-a-dub-dub of Jean Bart&rsquo;s
guns went drumming against her starboard side.
Crash! Crash! Crash! Her boards were split, her
mizzen-mast was swaying, and her rigging was near
cut in two. Men were falling fast and two of her
guns had blown up and were rendered useless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surrender!&rdquo; came a sharp hail from the lusty
throat of Jean Bart, and, as he spoke, a perfect hail
of grape came from his French ally, now creeping up
to port for a chance to grapple and board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; sighed the stout, Dutch commander,
turning to one of his lieutenants. &ldquo;Boy, haul
down our flag!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
So down came the emblem of the States General
amidst ringing cheers from the throats of the followers
of Jean Bart. They had won a notable
victory.</p>

<p>When the <i>Esperance</i> was towed and half-sailed into
Dunkirk harbor, old Antoine Sauret was there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my friends,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I always told you that
my boy, Jean Bart, would make a great name for himself.
Three times three for the great privateer of
Dunkirk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And all the bystanders joined in right willingly.</p>

<p>Not long after this event, our hero&rsquo;s ship was lying
in the harbor of Bergen in Sweden. The captain of
an English vessel met him on shore, and, after having
a chat with him, remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear that you have quite a reputation for fighting
your ship. I, too, am a sea warrior and would
like to have a little affair with you. My own vessel
is of about the same tonnage as yours, so that
we could meet upon even terms. Will you join
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would be delighted,&rdquo; answered the war-like Jean
Bart. &ldquo;If you wait two days I will be ready for you
and will fight you three miles off the coast. Meanwhile
I must lie here and take on some stores which
are much needed by both men and guns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Englishman smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a man after my own heart,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Good-by until we meet in battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three days after this, Jean Bart sent a boy to the
English vessel with a note for the captain. It ran:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;I am ready to fight you to-morrow. Meet me
three miles beyond the breakwater and may the best
man win. Until then&mdash;good luck.</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;Yours for battle,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Jean Bart</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The boy came back bearing a return missive from
the Englishman, who wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Monsieur Bart</span>: I am delighted to learn that
you want to fight me, and will do so. You are indeed
a brave man. But&mdash;before we go for each other&rsquo;s
throats&mdash;pray let us breakfast together. Will you
therefore take your morning meal with me, to-morrow,
in my own cabin, aboard my ship? I shall expect
you.</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;Yours to count on,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Middleton</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I do not want to accept, but I will,&rdquo; mused Captain
Bart. &ldquo;These English fellows are far too polite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, next morning, he was rowed to the British vessel
and was soon breakfasting with his red-faced opponent.</p>

<p>After the meal the Frenchman lighted his pipe,
took a few puffs, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur, I have greatly enjoyed this peaceful
repast. But it is now time for me to go and sharpen
my boarding-pike. I must bid you adieu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Englishman smiled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You cannot go. You are my
prisoner!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean Bart still smoked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are too quick!&rdquo; he answered, slowly.
&ldquo;There you are wrong. I am not your prisoner, for
I see a barrel of gunpowder on the deck, and, if you
do not release me immediately, I will blow up your
ship!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Englishman turned pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch me!&rdquo; cried Jean Bart.</p>

<p>Leaping from his seat, he rushed to the deck, lighted
a match from his pipe, and held it directly over the
mouth of a barrel of gunpowder, from which someone
had pried the head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lay on! You cowards!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Lay on,
and we&rsquo;ll all go to the Land of the Hereafter together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His cry was heard upon his own vessel, which&mdash;with
sails up&mdash;lay waiting for him.</p>

<p>In a moment her bow was turned towards the
British ship which was still at anchor, with sails unhoisted.
In a moment she dropped down alongside&mdash;and&mdash;in
less time than it takes to tell&mdash;the Frenchmen
had brought her upon the port quarter, and were
swarming across the deck to rescue their bold captain.</p>

<p>Taken by surprise, the English put up a plucky fight,
but they were no match for the infuriated men of
Dunkirk. They were soon overpowered. The captain
was taken prisoner, and the vessel was considered
a legitimate prize of war, because of the trick which
Middleton had attempted to play upon Jean Bart.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
When&mdash;in a few days&mdash;the prize was sailed into
Dunkirk harbor&mdash;the Englishman well wished that
he had not attempted to capture the most able privateersman
of all France.</p>

<p>The fame of this exploit spread over the land, and
gave rise to a ditty, which ran:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;If you want to catch Jean Bart, sir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A slippery, slimy chap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don&rsquo;t bait him with gunpowder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he&rsquo;s sure to miss the trap.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must splice him down with chains, sir;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must nail him to the deck.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put a belt around his middle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a collar &rsquo;round his neck.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even then you cannot hold him,<br /></span>

<span class="i9">doo!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In July, 1675, Jean Bart was married, but he did
not remain long on shore. Three weeks after this
auspicious event he once more put to sea and captured
a number of Dutch fishing boats, which he allowed the
captains to ransom for large sums of money.</p>

<p>This was a very convenient arrangement, for it
saved him the trouble of putting part of his own crew
on board and sending the boats to port. But the owners
of <i>La Royale</i>, upon which he sailed, did not care
for his methods of procedure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot do this in future!&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;And
you must forfeit half of what you took to us!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
Jean Bart obeyed, but he was very angry. It is
even said that he uttered &ldquo;a round seaman&rsquo;s oath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So successful was he, in fact, that he was given a
much larger vessel in 1676. This was a frigate&mdash;the
<i>Palme</i>&mdash;with twenty-four guns and a crew of
one hundred and fifty men. Sailing into the North
Sea with two small French gun-boats, he soon fell in
with three Dutch privateers and eight armed whaling
vessels. He attacked, and the battle raged for three
long, bloody hours.</p>

<p>When the smoke and the fumes of sulphur burned
away, Bart had boarded the largest privateer, while his
two consorts had taken the eight whalers. The other
Dutch privateers found it too hot for their liking and
scudded for the coast, firing their stern-guns derisively
as they disappeared. It was a great victory, and again
the French coast rung with salvos for Jean Bart, while
the old sea-dogs shrugged their shoulders, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Ha! Did we not tell you that Dunkirk bred
men of bone and marrow. Ah! Ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Jean Bart was not happy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would that I could meet a foe of my own force,&rdquo;
he used to say. &ldquo;Either a man-of-war or a privateer,
I don&rsquo;t care which. I want to try it on with one of
my own size and strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His wish was soon to be gratified.</p>

<p>On September 7th, 1676, he was pointing the <i>Palme</i>
towards the Belgian coast-line, when he sighted a
number of sail on the starboard quarter. He headed
for them; scanned the white dots through a glass, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
saw that this was a fishing fleet of small, unarmed
luggers. But a big, hulking Dutch frigate hovered
in their rear, and thirty-two guns pointed their brown
muzzles menacingly from her open port-holes. She
was the <i>Neptune</i> and she lazed along like a huge
whale: omnipotent and self-satisfied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah ha!&rdquo; cried the delighted Jean Bart. &ldquo;Now
I have met an enemy that is worthy of my steel. Up
with the flag and sail into yonder Dutchman. We
have but twenty-four guns to her thirty-two, but are
we to be awed by this show of force? Be ready, my
boys, to have the stiffest fight in your careers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Dutchman was equally well pleased when he
saw who was coming for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is Jean Bart, the pirate and privateer,&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;For three years I&rsquo;ve been hoping to have a
fight with him and now my chance has come at last.
I am fortunate, for I can pay him back for all the
damage that he has done to Dutch commerce. Shoot
low, my hearties, and do not fail to hull our enemy.
Let your war-cry be: &lsquo;Down with Jean Bart and his
pirate crew!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted his men.</p>

<p>And an answering</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo; came from the <i>Palme</i>. These opponents
were as eager to get at each other as two prize-fighters
of modern days.</p>

<p><em>Crash!</em> roared a broadside from the Dutch frigate
as her flag went aloft, and splash, splash, splash, went
her shells around the sides of the privateer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sail in close!&rdquo; yelled Jean Bart. &ldquo;Hug her to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
leeward for awhile, then cross her bows, rake her, get
her wind, and board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo; shouted the men of Dunkirk, and a
rattle, rattle, roar came from the port guns of the
<i>Palme</i>.</p>

<p>Around and around swung the sea gladiators and
the little fishing boats luffed and tittered on the waves
like inquisitive sparrows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bart cannot win!&rdquo; said several of their skippers.
&ldquo;For he&rsquo;s outweighted and outnumbered!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Bart was fighting like John Paul Jones.</p>

<p>Around and around went the two opponents, guns
growling, men cheering, sails slapping and ripping
with the chain and solid shot. Again and again Jean
Bart endeavored to get a favorable position for boarding
and again and again he was forced to tack away
by the quick man&oelig;uvres of the Dutchman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire into her rigging!&rdquo; he now thundered.
&ldquo;Cripple those topsails and I can bring my boat
alongside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Crash! Crash! Crash!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Volley after volley puffed from the side of the
rolling <i>Palme</i>. Volley after volley poured its lead and
iron into the swaying rigging of the Dutchman, and,
with a great roaring, ripping, and smashing, the
mizzen topmast came toppling over the lee rail.</p>

<p>A lusty cheer sounded from the deck of the <i>Palme</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s ours!&rdquo; cried Jean Bart, smiling.</p>

<p>Instantly he spun over the wheel, luffed, and
brought his boat upon the starboard quarter of the
Dutchman, who was now part helpless. It took but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
a moment to run alongside, and, in a moment more,
the <i>Palme</i> was lashed to the <i>Neptune</i> in a deadly embrace.
Smoke rolled from the sides of both contestants
and the roar of the guns drowned the shrill cries
of the wounded. The Dutchmen were now desperate
and their guns were spitting fire in rapid, successive
volleys; but many of them were silenced, as the great,
brown side of the <i>Palme</i> rubbed its planking against
the splintered railing of the shattered <i>Neptune</i>.</p>

<p>As the vessels were securely bound together, Jean
Bart seized a boarding-pike, a brace of pistols, and,
giving the helm to a sailor, leaped into the waist of
his ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Board! Board!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>

<p>A wild yelp greeted these welcome sounds. As he
vaulted over the rail of his own ship to the deck of
the stranger, a motley crew of half-wild sea-savages
swarmed behind him. They had cutlasses and boarding-pikes,
and their faces were blackened with powder.
Their eyes were reddened with sulphurous fumes and
their clothes torn with splintered planking. They
rolled over the gunwales like a huge wave of irresistible
fire: pistols spitting, pikes gleaming, cutlasses
glistening in the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Neptune</i> lay near his own wheel,
grievously wounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lay on, men!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let this
French privateer beat us. We will be disgraced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But his sailors were no match for the onrush of
these fiends from Dunkirk. They fell back like foam
before a sea squall.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then down with our flag,&rdquo; cried the captain of
the Dutchman. &ldquo;But, ye gods, how it hurts me to
give the order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sailor seized the halyards and pulled the ensign
to the deck, and, as it fell upon the reddened planking,
a wild, frenzied cheer came from the French privateers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jean Bart, forever! France forever! Jean Bart
forever!&rdquo; they cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up with the French flag!&rdquo; yelled Jean Bart,
laughing like a boy. &ldquo;Up with the white lilies of
France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, as a spare ensign ran aloft, the little fishing
luggers scudded for the shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After them, men!&rdquo; cried Captain Bart. &ldquo;Our
work is not yet over. We must have the lambs as
well as the old wolf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, sail was soon clapped on the <i>Palme</i>, she headed
for the fleeing boats, and, with a few well directed
shots, hove them to. Then they were told to follow
behind and head for France, which they did&mdash;but,
oh! how it did hurt!</p>

<p>It was a proud moment for Jean Bart, and his eyes
danced with pleasure when he sailed into Dunkirk with
the captured <i>Neptune</i> and the fleet of fishing boats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Voil&agrave;!&rdquo; cried the townspeople. &ldquo;Jean Bart is a
true hero. Voil&agrave;! He shall have the freedom of the
city. Voil&agrave;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fame of this gallant exploit soon spread abroad
and the king showed some desire to see this courageous
privateersman.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
&ldquo;I would have him at court,&rdquo; said he to his minister
Colbert. &ldquo;For I would reward him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When news of this was brought to the privateersman
he was naturally delighted, and, travelling to
Versailles, was ushered into the presence of his Majesty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is a gold chain for you,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;I
trust that you will keep it in recognition of my appreciation
of your gallant conduct. I would be glad, indeed,
to have you in the Royal Service. Would you
not take a commission?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You overwhelm me,&rdquo; answered the valiant sea-fighter,
blushing. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;am quite disconcerted.
But&mdash;if it would please your Majesty, I
believe that I would prefer to remain a simple privateer.
It is a free life and it suits my roving nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The king chuckled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But my good sir, keep yourself
in readiness for a commission. I may need you in
the Royal Marine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good, Sire!&rdquo; said Jean Bart, and, bowing
low, he withdrew.</p>

<p>But he did not get away without an adventure,&mdash;quite
as exciting as any he had had aboard the rocking
decks of one of his privateer ships.</p>

<p>The fame of Jean Bart had stirred up a number of
enemies, for, when a man is successful in life, are there
not always a hundred unsuccessful fellows who stand
about and scoff?</p>

<p>Among these were a few followers of the sea who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
had determined to make way with this too fortunate
privateer. One&mdash;Jules Blanc by name&mdash;even decided
upon murder, if Jean Bart would not agree to
leave the privateering business to himself and his
companions.</p>

<p>As the sailor from Dunkirk left the presence of
the king he was accosted by one of his old acquaintances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha, Jean Bart,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Come with me to the
Inn. Have a glass with me, my boy, for I see that
the king has richly rewarded you. You deserve it,
for you have done well, and you must be tired from
your journey. Come, let us dine together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suspecting nothing, the gallant privateer followed
his companion quite willingly, and, when he arrived
at the Inn, was not surprised to find several other seamen
from Dunkirk and the neighboring seaports of
France. They greeted him warmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To your health!&rdquo; cried they, raising their glasses
of wine. &ldquo;To the health of the bravest privateer in
all of France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean Bart was delighted. He smiled like a child,
seated himself at their table, and began to drink with
these jovial men of the sea.</p>

<p>As he sat there, suddenly a paper was mysteriously
shoved into his hand. He did not see from whence
it came, and, as he scanned its contents, his face grew
strangely pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beware of these fellows,&rdquo; he read. &ldquo;They mean
to kill you if you do not do what they wish. Beware!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
Jean Bart soon regained his composure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come! Let us go to the dining-room up-stairs,&rdquo;
said the friend who had first accosted him. &ldquo;Come,
my boys! We will there have far more quiet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All moved for the door.</p>

<p>Jean Bart moved, also, but before he went up-stairs,
he loosened his sword-belt and cocked two pistols
which he carried at his waist. He was not surprised
when he saw them lock the stout door as they
entered the room upon the second floor.</p>

<p>When they were all seated Jules Blanc arose. His
face well exhibited his dislike for the successful privateersman,
Jean Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, my friend,&rdquo; said he, facing the man from
Dunkirk, &ldquo;we have you here with a purpose. We
wish you to know that we are determined that you
shall no longer go to sea and spoil our own business
for us. You have had enough success. We
want you to withdraw and give some one else a
chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jean Bart smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We think that you should retire for we want
some pickings for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I refuse?&rdquo; queried Jean Bart.</p>

<p>Jules Blanc placed his hand instantly upon his
sword-hilt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;there will be trouble!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poof!&rdquo; said Jean Bart.</p>

<p>As he spoke, all drew their rapiers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again Poof!&rdquo; said Jean Bart.</p>

<p>As he spoke, a thrust came from his right. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
parried it, leaped upon a chair, and stood there smiling.</p>

<p>Crack! There was the sound of a pistol and a
bullet whizzed by his ear.</p>

<p>Then there was a sudden and awful <em>Crash!</em> The
room was filled with dust.</p>

<p>When the startled sea-dogs looked about them Jean
Bart no longer stood upon the table. He had disappeared
through the window. And broken glass with
splintered fastenings was all that remained of the once
perfect glazing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has gone,&rdquo; said Jules Blanc. &ldquo;Fellow seamen,
we are outdone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Jean Bart was a quarter of a mile away, laughing
softly to himself, as he sped along the highway
which led to quiet Dunkirk.</p>

<p>Things went well with him, also, for his employers&mdash;appreciating
his past services&mdash;now gave him
command of a larger ship than the <i>Palme</i>: the <i>Dauphin</i>,
with thirty guns and two hundred eager and
adventurous sailors from the northern coast of France.</p>

<p>Sailing forth from Dunkirk harbor, on June 18th,
1678, Jean Bart eagerly scanned the horizon with his
glass. With him were two smaller privateers, so that
he felt well able to cope with any adversary from Holland.
His keen glance was soon to be rewarded, for
when but two days from port he spied a sail upon the
starboard bow. It was a Dutch frigate&mdash;the <i>Sherdam</i>&mdash;of
forty guns and manned by many stout dogs
of the sea. Her captain&mdash;Andr&eacute; Ranc&mdash;was a keen
fighter and a man of well-tried courage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
&ldquo;Bear off to leeward!&rdquo; signalled Jean Bart to his
privateer companion. &ldquo;Then we will get the stranger
between us, fasten to her, and board her from either
side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The flag of the French privateer dipped back an
answering, &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; and, as she was nearest to
the Dutchman, she attacked at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Poom! Poom!</em>&rdquo; went the Dutch cannon, like the
beating of a churn in that land of canals and cheese-making.
And <em>piff! piff!</em> answered the little howitzers
of the privateer.</p>

<p>But Jean Bart meant to have a quick fight, so he
bore down to starboard, wore ship, and ran so close to
the enemy, that his grappling irons soon held her fast.
In a moment more his own vessel was hauled alongside.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the smaller French privateer had
spanked over to larboard; had run up upon the opposite
side of the lumbering Dutchman; and had also
gripped her. A wild, nerve-wracking cheer went up,
as&mdash;sword in hand&mdash;Jean Bart led his boarders
over the side of the Dutch vessel.</p>

<p>Ranc was badly wounded but he led his men to a
counter assault with courage born of desperation.
Cutlasses crashed together, boarding-pikes smashed
and hacked, and pistols growled and spattered in
one discordant roar. Back went the Dutch sailors
fighting savagely and bluntly with all the stubbornness
of their natures, then back they pushed the
followers of Jean Bart, while Ranc called to
them:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
&ldquo;Drive these French curs into the sea!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="bart_led_his_boarders" id="bart_led_his_boarders"></a>

</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;JEAN BART LED HIS BOARDERS OVER THE SIDE OF THE DUTCH VESSEL.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But now the other privateer had made fast, and her
men came clambering over the rail, with cutlass, dirk,
and pistols.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re outnumbered,&rdquo; Ranc shouted, his face
showing extreme suffering. &ldquo;Haul down the flag!
Had Jean Bart been here alone I could have trounced
him well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus reluctantly and sadly the flag of the <i>Sherdam</i>
came down. But the French had paid well for their victory.</p>

<p>Jean Bart was badly wounded in the leg; his face
was burned by the discharge of a gun, which went off&mdash;almost
in his eyes&mdash;just as he leaped on board the
<i>Sherdam</i>. Six of his men were killed and thirty-one
were wounded, while the little privateer that had
fastened to the other flank of the huge <i>Sherdam</i>, was
a total wreck. So well, indeed, had the Dutch fighters
plied their cannon as she approached, that she was
shattered almost beyond repair. With great difficulty
she was finally towed to shore.</p>

<p>Of course all France again rang with the fame of
Jean Bart, while the crafty sea-dogs who had endeavored
to capture the slippery privateersman were
furious with envious rage. But Jean Bart hummed
a little tune to himself, which ran,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to get up early if you want to catch Jean Bart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You&rsquo;ll have to get up early, and have a goodly start,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the early bird can catch the worm, if the worm is fast asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not if it&rsquo;s a privateer, who can through a window leap.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
This invincible corsair was also not idle, for in two
weeks&rsquo; time he was again at sea in the <i>Mars</i> of thirty-two
guns, and a fast sailer. Eagerly looking for
prizes, he cruised far up the coast of Holland and was
keenly hunting for either merchantman or frigate,
when a small vessel neared him, upon which was flying
a white flag.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A truce!&rdquo; cried Jean Bart. &ldquo;The war must be
over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the little boat drew nearer, a fat Dutchman
called out something which sounded like, &ldquo;Amsterdam
yam Goslam!&rdquo; which meant, &ldquo;Peace has been declared,&rdquo;
in Dutch.</p>

<p>So Jean Bart sailed back into the sheltering harbor
of Dunkirk with tears of sorrow in his eyes, for he
loved his exciting life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helas!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is all over!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus, indeed, ended the career of Jean Bart as a
privateer captain. In January, 1679, he was given the
commission of lieutenant in the French navy, but,
although he accepted, he was never happy in this
service. From captain to lieutenant was a decided
come down, and besides this, the aristocratic officers
of the Crown made life very unpleasant for one who
had entered their ranks from privateering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;He is only a commoner!&rdquo;
And they would turn up their titled noses.</p>

<p>But&mdash;mark you this!</p>

<p>Several hundred years have passed since those days,
and Jean Bart&rsquo;s name is still remembered. Who remembers
the names of any of these titled nobles who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
held commissions from his Majesty, the King of
France?</p>

<p>I do not think that any of you do. Certainly I do
not.</p>

<p>Therefore, there is a little lesson to be learned, and
it is this:</p>

<p>Never sneer at the fellow who accomplishes things,
if he be of humble birth. <em>His</em> name may go down to
history. <em>Yours</em> probably will not.</p>

<p>So, the next time that you are tempted to do this,
think it over. If you do, you will not say, &ldquo;Pish,&mdash;the
Commoner!&rdquo; But you will say,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well done! The Hero!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, good-by, Jean Bart, and may France produce
your like again, if she can!</p>

<p class="author">&mdash;<i>Song of the French Royal Marine.</i>&mdash;1695.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">Y</span>OU <em>must</em> be a churchman, R&eacute;nee,&rdquo; said the
good Luc Trouin, turning to his little son.
&ldquo;I have always had a great ambition to have
a child of mine in the church, and I feel that you are
in every way qualified for the position of a prelate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But little R&eacute;nee hung his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look up, boy,&rdquo; continued the amiable Frenchman.
&ldquo;I know that you are not now pleased with the idea,
but&mdash;later on&mdash;after you have had more experience,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
I feel sure that you can thank Heaven that your good
father started you in the right and proper direction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still, little R&eacute;nee hung his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut! Tut!&rdquo; continued the old man. &ldquo;You will
leave, to-morrow, for the college at Rheims, and, after
you have been there but a short time, I feel sure that
you will like it. Tut! Tut!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But still little R&eacute;nee hung his head.</p>

<p>Again came the amiable &ldquo;Tut! Tut!&rdquo; and the
chuckling Luc Trouin wandered off into the garden
to see how well the potatoes were growing.</p>

<p>But little R&eacute;nee still hung his head.</p>

<p>And&mdash;in spite of the fact that little R&eacute;nee went to
the Divinity school at Rheims, he continued to hang
his head. He hung his head for three years. Then,
news was brought to him, one day, that the good Luc
Trouin was dead, and, instead of holding his handkerchief
to his eyes to wipe away the tears, as one
would expect of him, little R&eacute;nee burst into loud
laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I can get away from the
church and go to sea. At last my freedom has come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And it was not many hours before little R&eacute;nee was
scudding away from the school of Divinity, like a
clipper-ship under a full spread of canvas, before a
rousing sou&rsquo;west breeze.</p>

<p>For at least two hundred years before the birth of
bad, little R&eacute;nee, the Trouin family had been well
known and prosperous in the Breton seaport of St.
Malo. For many years a Trouin had been consul at
Malaga, Spain; and other members of the house had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
held excellent positions with the King, so little R&eacute;nee
had no reason to be ashamed of his forebears, in spite
of the fact that his people were of the &ldquo;bourgeoisie:&rdquo;
ship-owners, traders, smugglers, privateers, and merchants.
And, as they were of the &ldquo;bourgeoisie,&rdquo; they
were somewhat looked down upon by the proud and
haughty aristocrats who fawned about the weak and
dissipated King.</p>

<p>Little R&eacute;nee was the son of Luc Trouin and Marguerite
Boscher but he was called Du Guay-Trouin,
in later years, and the reason for this is plain. For&mdash;in
accordance with the custom of the time&mdash;he was
sent to be nursed by a foster mother who resided in
the little village of Le Gu&eacute;. So he was called Trouin
du Gu&eacute;; which shortly became Du Guay-Trouin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come home, mother,&rdquo; shouted little R&eacute;nee,
when he had plodded his weary way which lay between
his temporary prison and the house of his parents.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come home, mother, and I&rsquo;m going to sea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But his mother did not take any too kindly to this
bold and valiant idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must study law,&rdquo; said she, with great firmness.
And&mdash;in spite of the fact that little R&eacute;nee
begged and pleaded&mdash;he was forced to give up his
idea of seafaring life for the dry drudgery and routine
of a clerk at law. He was now about sixteen
years of age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The law is dry and my spirits are high,&rdquo; youthful
R&eacute;nee is said to have carolled as he spent his first few
hours at a lecture, &ldquo;and whatever may be I&rsquo;m going
to sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
At any rate, he soon got into trouble and engaged
in three duels in his sixteenth year, in one of which
his assailant gave him a serious wound. This was
too much for even his stern mother to bear, so, summoning
a family council, she gave forth the following opinion:</p>

<p>&ldquo;R&eacute;nee has failed as a student of Divinity. R&eacute;nee
has failed as a student of law. R&eacute;nee has entirely too
high spirits. R&eacute;nee shall, therefore, be placed in one
of the family ships and sent to sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And to this decree R&eacute;nee is said to have cried:
&ldquo;At last! Hurray!&rdquo; for he longed for action.</p>

<p>In a very short time little R&eacute;nee had a taste of that
war and adventure which he craved, for a historian
writes that:</p>

<p>&ldquo;During the first three months of this cruise his
courage was tried by a violent tempest, an imminent
shipwreck, the boarding of an English ship, and the
threatened destruction of his own vessel by fire. The
following year, still as a volunteer, he displayed the
greatest personal courage and won much fame in an
engagement which his ship had with five merchant
vessels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah ha,&rdquo; said little R&eacute;nee, &ldquo;this is indeed life. I
am having a good time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So well did those higher in command feel towards
the youthful sailor, that, at the age of eighteen, he was
actually put in charge of the ship <i>Danycan</i> of fourteen
guns,&mdash;for France was at war with England, Holland,
and Spain, and to him who could strike a quick
and well-aimed blow there were &ldquo;nice pickings&rdquo; to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
be had. And the reckless young sea-dog found some
&ldquo;nice pickings&rdquo; in Ireland, for, he landed an armed
party upon the coast of County Clare, where he pillaged
a village, burned two ships at anchor, and escaped
to his own vessel with considerable booty
and family heirlooms of the peasants, who said,
&ldquo;Och, Begorra! We&rsquo;ll be afther that wild bhoy
before many suns, and spank him for his unseemly
whork.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the French cried &ldquo;Voil&agrave;! Here, indeed, is a
brave young Bourgeois,&rdquo; and promptly raised him to
the command of the <i>Coetquen</i> of eighteen guns, in
which he soon went cruising, accompanied by a sister-ship,
the <i>St. Aaron</i>.</p>

<p>Prowling around the English channel, the skulking
sea-hounds soon came across two small English men-of-war
with five valuable merchantmen under their
sheltering wings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready for the attack!&rdquo; shouted Du Guay-Trouin.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make mince-meat of those foreign
hulks, in spite of the fact that they are protected by
two men-of-war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, crowding on all sail, his own vessel and the
<i>St. Aaron</i> quickly bore down upon the Englishmen,
who, seeing them approach, hove-to for action.</p>

<p>The engagement was short. After a few broadsides
had been delivered, the English struck, the prizes
were taken over, and all started for the coast of
France. But suddenly a cry went up,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sail ho! Sail ho! off the starboard bow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ta Donc,&rdquo; cried the surprised Du Guay-Trouin.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
&ldquo;It is a big man-of-warsman and a Britisher too.
We must give up our prizes, I fear. Clap on all canvas
and we&rsquo;ll hie us to shore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So all sail was hoisted, and, steering for the shoals
and rocks off Lundy Island&mdash;where he knew that
the heavy Englishman could not follow&mdash;Du Guay-Trouin
soon outdistanced and outwitted the <i>Centurion</i>:
a line-of-battle ship and a formidable opponent.
The rich prizes had to be left behind.</p>

<p>Honorable appointments crowded upon the daring,
young sea-dog, after this affair, and we find him successively
in command of the <i>Profond</i>, of thirty-two
guns; the <i>Hercule</i>, of twenty-eight guns, and the
<i>Diligente</i> of thirty-six guns and two hundred and
fifty sailors, which was a King&rsquo;s ship borrowed for
privateering and run on shares,&mdash;the monarch to
have a certain part of the winnings.</p>

<p>Like partners in business the <i>Diligente</i> and <i>Hercule</i>
now went cruising, and it was not long before the
two harpies swooped down upon their prey in the
shape of two Dutch East Indiamen, armed with
twenty-five guns each, and manned by rotund-bodied
Dutchmen. There was rich treasure aboard, and, with
eagerness and zeal, the Frenchmen slapped on all canvas
in pursuit.</p>

<p>Now was a hot chase. Mile after mile was passed,
and slowly but surely the Frenchmen gained upon the
lumbering foe. Then suddenly,&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Crash!</em></p>

<p>A ball screamed above the head of Du Guay-Trouin,
and a Dutchman hove-to for battle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
&ldquo;Crawl in close,&rdquo; cried the valiant Frenchman,
&ldquo;and don&rsquo;t let go a broadside until you can hit &rsquo;em
below the water line. Try to scuttle the Dutch lumber
merchant!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His men obeyed him willingly and soon there was
a muffled roar as the first broadside spoke in the still
air. Another and another followed, and the Dutchman
trembled like an aspen leaf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hah,&rdquo; shouted the enthusiastic R&eacute;nee, &ldquo;up goes
the white flag!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, the vessel struck, and aboard of her
was the Dutch commodore. But the <i>Hercule</i> was
beaten off by the second Dutchman, and, as the privateers
boarded the captured vessel, the East Indiaman
showed a clean pair of heels, under a cloud of
bellying canvas.</p>

<p>Du Guay-Trouin was delighted. &ldquo;On we go,
Boys,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;for we&rsquo;ll sail these waters until we
strike another prize.&rdquo; And this is what soon happened.</p>

<p>On May the 12th, the <i>Diligente</i> was cruising alone,
when, suddenly six white dots appeared upon the
horizon, and six British ships-of-the-line were soon
closing in upon the venturous French navigator and
his crew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye Gods,&rdquo; cried the doughty Frenchman, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
in for it now, but we will give them a lively bout even
though we&rsquo;ll get the worst of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And here is how he has described the battle:</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the English ships named <i>Adventure</i> first
overtook me, and we maintained a running fight for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
nearly four hours, before any other of their ships
could come up....</p>

<p>&ldquo;At length my two topmasts were shot away; on
which the <i>Adventure</i> ranged up alongside me, a short
pistol-shot off, and hauled up her courses. Seeing
her so near, it occurred to me to run foul of her and
board her with my whole crew. Forthwith I ordered
such of the officers as were near to send the people on
deck, got ready the grapnels, and put the helm over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were just on the point of hooking on to her,
when unfortunately, one of my Lieutenants, looking
out through a port and seeing the two ships so close
together, took it into his head that there was some
mistake, as he could not think that&mdash;under the circumstances&mdash;I
had any intention of boarding; and
so, of himself, ordered the helm to be reversed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had no idea of what had been done, and was
impatiently waiting for the two ships to clash together,
ready to throw myself on board the enemy; but seeing
that my ship did not obey her helm, I ran to the
wheel, and found it had been changed without my
order.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had it again jammed hard on; but perceived,
with the keenest vexation, that the captain of the
<i>Adventure</i>, having guessed by the expression of my
face what I had meant to do, had let fall his courses,
and was sheering off. We had been so near that my
bowsprit had broken his taffrail; but the mistake of
my Lieutenant made me lose the opportunity of one
of the most surprising adventures ever heard tell of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the determination I was in to perish or to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
capture this ship, which was much the fastest sailor of the
squadron, it was more than probable that I should have
succeeded, and should thus have taken back to France
a much stronger ship than that which I abandoned.
And, not to speak of the credit which would have
attached to the execution of such a plan, it is quite
certain that&mdash;being dismasted&mdash;there was absolutely
no other way for me to escape from forces so superior.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But closer&mdash;always closer&mdash;crowded the British
war-dogs, and the valorous French seamen became
panic stricken. &ldquo;We are outnumbered and outfought,&rdquo;
cried many, and, deserting their guns, they
fled below to the holds, in spite of the vigorous protests
of Du Guay-Trouin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was busy trying to put a stop to the panic,&rdquo;
says he. &ldquo;I had cut down one and pistolled another,
when, to crown my misfortune, fire broke out in the
gun-room. The fear of being blown up made it necessary
for me to go below; but, having got the fire put
out, I had a tub full of grenades brought me, and
began throwing them down into the hold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By this means I compelled the deserters to come
up and to man some of the lower deck guns; but,
when I went up on the poop, I found, to my astonishment
and vexation, that some cowardly rascal had
taken advantage of my absence to haul down the
colors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ordered them to be hoisted again; but my officers
represented that to do so would be simply giving
up the remnant of my ship&rsquo;s company to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
butchered by the English, who would give no quarter
if the flag were hoisted again, after being struck for
so long, and that further resistance was hopeless as
the ship was dismasted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never give in, for&rdquo;&mdash;cried Du Guay-Trouin,
whose democratic blood was now up, but he did not
finish the sentence as a spent shot then knocked him
senseless. And&mdash;as he fell&mdash;the white flag went
aloft, for his officers had not his fighting spirit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah ha,&rdquo; laughed the English jack-tars. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got the French rascal at last, and we&rsquo;ll hold him
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So little R&eacute;nee was imprisoned in a nice, dark
dungeon,&mdash;the kind which the English used to put
their poor debtors in. But&mdash;like a true man of courage&mdash;little
R&eacute;nee escaped, took to a smuggler&rsquo;s skiff,
and made off to the coast of France, where he arrived
on the 18th of June, 1694, and was received right
boisterously by the Trouin family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; spoke his aged mother, &ldquo;you were
indeed not intended for the law, for lawlessness seems
to be your particular fancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the delighted Trouins put him in charge of a
splendid privateersman mounting forty-eight guns,
sailing under the simple name of <i>Francois</i>, and, as
she forged valiantly into the English channel, her
skipper chanted an old French song, which ran,&mdash;</p>

<p>It was not long before a sail was sighted, and, on
the 12th day of January, 1695, the stout, little <i>Francois</i>
overhauled a solitary timber ship, loaded with huge
trees, bound to England from the good town of Boston
in New England. She was an easy capture, and,
Du Guay-Trouin smiled with joy when her skipper
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three other lumber ships are in the offing. But
they are under convoy of the frigate <i>Nonsuch</i> with
forty-eight guns, and the <i>Falcon</i> with thirty-eight
cannon. Look out my bold sea-dog, there&rsquo;ll be
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the French mariner laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;m searching for,&rdquo; said he, and
forthwith he swung the stout <i>Francois</i> in wide circles,
with look-outs at every mast-head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sail ho!&rdquo; shouted the watch, next morn, and
there, off the port bow, were the three merchantmen
strung out in a line, with the two protecting gun-boats
to windward.</p>

<p>Like a greyhound the <i>Francois</i> swept down upon
them, and with the audacity of despair, the privateersman
of St. Malo ranged alongside of the <i>Falcon</i> and
opened fire. The engagement was short. In an hour&rsquo;s
time the guns of the Englishman were silent and a
white pennon fluttered from the mizzen-mast.</p>

<p>The <i>Nonsuch</i>, meanwhile, had been ranging to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
windward in a vain endeavor to bring her guns to
bear upon the Frenchman without crippling her own
mate, and&mdash;as the <i>Francois</i> drifted away from the
lurching <i>Falcon</i>&mdash;she bore down to within twenty
yards, luffed, and spanked a rakish broadside into
the privateer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Board her!&rdquo; shouted Du Guay-Trouin. &ldquo;Board
her!&rdquo; and, bringing the wheel close around, he swung
the bow of the <i>Francois</i> into the side of the Englishman.
But, as the sailors scampered to the bulwarks
with cutlass and with dirk, a sheet of flame burst from
the port-holes of the drifting <i>Nonsuch</i>. She was afire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luff! Luff!&rdquo; cried the keen-eyed French mariner,
and the <i>Francois</i> drew away as the red flames
curled upward with a cruel hiss.</p>

<p>With a swift turn the helm again spun over, under
the quick hand of Du Guay-Trouin, and the <i>Francois</i>
was jibed about in order to run under the port bow
of the Englishman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold, Captain!&rdquo; cried a French Lieutenant.
&ldquo;We, ourselves, are afire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke&mdash;a direful cloud of vapor rolled from
the starboard quarter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alack!&rdquo; answered the now furious R&eacute;nee. &ldquo;This
puts an end to the fighting of this day, and we&rsquo;d soon
have had the second Britisher. All hands below and
bucket out this fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, as night fell upon the rolling ocean, the <i>Falcon</i>
lay drifting helplessly, while the <i>Nonsuch</i> and the
<i>Francois</i> were burning like two beacons upon a jutting
headland.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
As day broke, the <i>Francois</i> filled away (for the fire
had been extinguished after an hour&rsquo;s toil) and ranged
within striking distance of the <i>Nonsuch</i>. A broadside
belched from her starboard guns and an answering
roar came back from the cannon of the Englishman.
The fore and main masts of the <i>Nonsuch</i> trembled
for a moment&mdash;then tottered and fell&mdash;while
the gallant Captain, struck in the chest by a flying
piece of shell, fell dying upon the deck. Du Guay-Trouin
again attempted to board, at this moment, but
the third mast was shaking and he was forced to
sheer off lest the tangle of yards and rigging should
fall and crush his vessel. He hung within hailing
distance of the crippled sea-warrior, and, seeing that
his antagonist was now helpless, cried out through
his trumpet:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run up the white flag, or I&rsquo;ll give you a broadside
that will sink you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No answering hail came from the deck of the battered
<i>Nonsuch</i>, but the piece of a torn, white shirt
was soon fluttering from the tangled rigging of the
foremast. Thus the gallant R&eacute;nee had defeated two
warships of equal strength, and had captured vessels
with a rich and valuable cargo. Now, don&rsquo;t you think
that this fellow was a doughty sea rover? And, although
the English made many excuses, the fact still
remains that a single privateer had conquered double
her own force in a fair and open fight upon the high
seas.</p>

<p>The sturdy <i>Francois</i> could just barely drift into St.
Malo&mdash;so badly crippled was she&mdash;but the rest came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
safely to port, in spite of a hard gale which blew down
the masts of two of the lumber boats. And doughty
R&eacute;nee refitted the <i>Nonsuch</i>, transferred his flag to
her, called her the <i>Sans-Pareil</i>, and flung his flag defiantly
from her mast-head in spite of the fact that
she was &ldquo;made in England.&rdquo; All France was agog
over his exploit.</p>

<p>Now, know you, that doughty R&eacute;nee was a
&ldquo;Blue;&rdquo; a &ldquo;Blue&rdquo; being a man of the people (the
bourgeoisie) who were not of aristocratic birth. And,
as the French Royal Marine was the most exclusive
body of officers in the world, birth and station being
necessary for admittance therein, the titled office-holders
threw up their hands when Du Guay-Trouin&rsquo;s
name was mentioned for a place of command, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s only a beastly Democrat. Pooh! Bah!
We do not care to have such a fellow among us.&rdquo;
And they shrugged their shoulders.</p>

<p>The officers of the French Royal Marine wore red
breeches, and, if by chance a democrat were given
a commission, he had to appear in blue small-clothes
throughout his entire career. Very few of the
&ldquo;Blues&rdquo; ever came to be an Admiral, for the odds
were too great against them.</p>

<p>But R&eacute;nee had done so bravely and well that a
sword was sent him by the King, who wrote,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should you wish a commission in the Royal Navy,
good sir, it shall be yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And to this, Du Guay-Trouin replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel that I can do better where I am, Most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
Gracious Majesty. I will remain a Privateer.&rdquo; For
Du Guay-Trouin wished to accumulate riches, as his
forebears had done.</p>

<p>So, cruising down the coast of Ireland, he fell in
with three East Indiamen, whom he captured with
ease, and, piloting them to St. Malo, declared a dividend
of two thousand pounds ($10,000) a share, to
the stockholders in his staunch vessel. And the value
of the shares was but one hundred pounds ($500)
each. Would not the men of Wall Street love such
a fellow in these piping times of peace?</p>

<p>A month later we find him cruising in the Bay of
Biscay, where&mdash;in the dead of night&mdash;he ran into
a great English fleet, roving about for just such vessels
as the <i>Sans-Pareil</i> and eager for a broadside at
the French privateer. But young R&eacute;nee&mdash;for he was
now twenty-three&mdash;had not lost his nerve. &ldquo;There
was no time,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;for hesitation. I had two
valuable prizes with me and ordered them to hoist
Dutch colors and to run away to leeward, saluting
me with seven guns each as they went.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Trusting to the goodness and soundness of the
<i>Sans-Pareil</i> I stood towards the fleet, as boldly and
as peaceably as if I had really been one of their number,
rejoining them after having spoken the Dutchmen.
Two capital ships and a thirty-six gun frigate
had at first left the fleet to overhaul me; but, on seeing
what I was doing, the ships returned to their
stations; the frigate&mdash;impelled by her unlucky fate&mdash;persisted
in endeavoring to speak the two prizes,
and I saw that she was rapidly coming up with them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
&ldquo;I had by this time joined the fleet, tranquil enough
in appearance, though inwardly I was fuming at the
prospect of my two prizes being taken by the frigate;
and, as I perceived that my ship sailed much
better than those of the enemy who were near me,
I kept away little by little, at the same time forereaching
on them. Suddenly, bearing up, I ran
down to place myself between the prizes and the
frigate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have liked to lay aboard of her and carry
her in sight of the whole fleet; but her captain, being
suspicious, would not let me get within musket-shot
of him, and sent his boat to help me. But, when the
boat was half way, her people made out that we were
French, and turned to go back; on which, seeing that
we were discovered, I hoisted my white flag and
poured my broadside into the frigate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She answered with hers; but, not being able to
sustain my fire, she hauled her wind, and with a signal
of distress flying, stood to meet the captain&rsquo;s ship,
which hastily ran down towards us. As they stopped
to render her assistance, and to pick up her boat, I
was able to rejoin my prizes, and, without misadventure,
to take them to Port Louis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again France rang with acclaim for the hero of
this bold exploit, and again the King offered a commission
to the gallant sea-dog. But Du Guay-Trouin
shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I will become an officer in the Royal
Marine later on,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But not now. I am too
happy and successful as a Privateer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
He was quite right, for in March, 1697, was his
greatest exploit.</p>

<p>While busily scanning the horizon for sail in the
<i>St. Jacques des Victoires</i>, upon the thirteenth day of
that auspicious month, he saw upon the horizon, a
cluster of vessels. They drew near and proved to be
the Dutch East India fleet convoyed by two fifty-gun
ships and a thirty-gun sloop-of-war. With him was
the <i>Sans-Pareil</i> of forty-eight guns, and the little
sloop-of-war <i>Lenore</i>, mounting fourteen. The hostile
squadron was formidable, and Du Guay-Trouin
hesitated to attack.</p>

<p>In command of the Dutch vessels was Baron van
Wassenaer, one of a family of famous sea-fighters
from Holland, and he man&oelig;uvred his ships with consummate
skill; always interposing his own vessel between
the French privateer and his fleet of merchantmen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah-ha,&rdquo; cried gallant R&eacute;nee, at this moment.
&ldquo;Here come some of my own boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And&mdash;sure enough&mdash;from the direction of France,
and boiling along under full canvas, rolled two privateersmen
of St. Malo. Cheer after cheer went up
from the deck of the <i>St. Jacques des Victoires</i>, as they
pounded through the spray, for this made the contending
parties about equal, although the Dutch boats
were larger, heavier, and they had more guns aboard.</p>

<p>The Dutchmen now formed in line. In front was
the flagship&mdash;the <i>Delft</i>&mdash;with her fifty guns glowering
ominously from the port-holes; second was the
thirty-gun frigate; and third, the other war-hound
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
of fifty guns: the <i>Hondslaardjiik</i>. Through a trumpet
Du Guay-Trouin shrilled his orders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Sans-Pareil</i> will attack the <i>Hondslaardjiik</i>,&rdquo;
cried he. &ldquo;The two privateers will hammer the frigate,
while I and the <i>St. Jacques des Victoires</i> will
attend to the <i>Delft</i>. The <i>Lenore</i> will sail in among
the convoy. Fight, and fight to win!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A fine breeze rippled the waves. The two squadrons
were soon at each others&rsquo; throats, and there upon
the sobbing ocean a sea-fight took place which was
one of the most stubborn of the ages.</p>

<p>As the Frenchmen closed in upon the Dutch, the
<i>Hondslaardjiik</i> suddenly left the line and crashed a
broadside into the <i>St. Jacques des Victoires</i>. It staggered
her, but she kept on, and&mdash;heading straight for
her lumbering antagonist&mdash;ran her down. A splitting
of timber, a crunch of boards, a growl of musketry,
and, with a wild cheer, the Frenchmen leaped
upon the deck of the Dutch warship; Du Guay-Trouin
in the lead, a cutlass in his right hand, a spitting
pistol in the left.</p>

<p><em>Crash! Crackle! Crash!</em> An irregular fire of
muskets and pistols sputtered at the on-coming boarders.
But they were not to be stopped. With fierce,
vindictive cheers the privateers of St. Malo hewed a
passage of blood across the decking, driving the
Dutchmen below, felling them upon the deck in windrows,
and seizing the commander himself by the coat
collar, after his cutlass had been knocked from his
stalwart hand. The Dutchman was soon a prize, and
her proud ensign came fluttering to the decking.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
But things were not going so well in other quarters.
Disaster had attended the dash of the <i>Sans-Pareil</i>
upon the <i>Delft</i>. An exploding shell had set her
afire and she lay derelict with a cloud of drifting
smoke above, when suddenly, <em>Crash!</em></p>

<p>A terrible explosion shook the staunch, little vessel,
her sides belched outward, and a number of sailors
came shooting through the air, for a dozen loose
cartridge boxes had been caught by the roaring flames.
Helplessly she lolled in the sweep of the gray, lurching
billows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; shouted Van Wassenaer, as he saw his
work. &ldquo;Now for the saucy Du Guay-Trouin,&rdquo; and,
twisting the helm of the <i>Sans-Pareil</i>, he soon neared
the <i>St. Jacques des Victoires</i>, which was hanging to
the <i>Delft</i> like a leech, firing broadside after broadside
with clock-like precision, her sea-dogs cheering as
the spars crackled, the rigging tore; and splinters
ricochetted from her sides.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready about!&rdquo; cried R&eacute;nee, wiping the sweat
from his brow, &ldquo;and board the <i>Hondslaardjiik</i>.
Now for Van Wassenaer and let us show the
Dutchman how a privateer from St. Malo can
battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, luffing around in the steady breeze, the privateersman
rolled ominously towards the lolling <i>Delft</i>.
A crash, a sputter of pistols, a crushing of timber, and
grappling hooks had pinioned the two war-dogs in a
sinister embrace. And&mdash;with a wild yell&mdash;the
Frenchmen plunged upon the reddened decking of the
flagship of the courageous Van Wassenaer, who cried,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
&ldquo;Never give in, Lads! What will they think of this
in Holland!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a different reception than when the privateers
rushed the <i>Hondslaardjiik</i>. The Dutch fought
like wildcats. Three times the cheering, bleeding
Frenchmen stormed the planking, and three times
they were hurled back upon the slippery deck of their
own ship; maddened, cursing, furious at their inability
to take the foreigner. &ldquo;The conflict was very
bloody both by the very heavy fire on both sides, of
guns, muskets, and grenades,&rdquo; says Du Guay-Trouin,
&ldquo;and by the splendid courage of the Baron Van
Wassenaer, who received me with astonishing boldness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bear away,&rdquo; ordered the courageous Dutchman,
at this juncture. &ldquo;We must have time to recover and
refit our ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And&mdash;suiting the action to his words&mdash;the
badly battered <i>Delft</i> filled, and crept well to leeward.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two privateers of St. Malo had captured
the frigate as she lay helpless; a white flag
beckoning for a prize crew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Faluere</i> will attack the <i>Delft</i>,&rdquo; shouted Du
Guay-Trouin, running near the largest of these; a
ship of thirty-eight guns. &ldquo;I must have time to
breathe and to refit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But stubborn Van Wassenaer was ready for his new
antagonist. He received the privateer with such a
furious fire that she turned tail and fled to leeward;
her captain bleeding upon the poop, her crew cursing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
the blood which ran in the veins of the valorous
Hollander.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p class="caption">COMBAT BETWEEN DU GUAY-TROUIN AND VAN WASSENAER.</p>

<p>Du Guay-Trouin had now recovered his breath.
Again the bellying canvas of the <i>St. Jacques des
Victoires</i> bore her down upon the <i>Delft</i>, and again
the two war-dogs wrapped in deadly embrace. Hear
the invincible Frenchman&rsquo;s own account of the final
assault:</p>

<p>&ldquo;With head down,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;I rushed against
the redoubtable Baron, resolved to conquer or to
perish. The last action was so sharp and so bloody
that every one of the Dutch officers was killed or
wounded. Wassenaer, himself, received four dangerous
wounds and fell on his quarterdeck, where he was
seized by my own brave fellows, his sword still in his
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Faluere</i> had her share in the engagement, running
alongside of me, and sending me forty men on
board for reinforcement. More than half of my own
crew perished in this action. I lost in it one of my
cousins, first Lieutenant of my own ship, and two
other kinsmen on board the <i>Sans-Pareil</i>, with many
other officers killed or wounded. It was an awful
butchery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But at last he had won, and the victorious pennon
of the Privateer fluttered triumphant over the battered
hulks which barely floated upon the spar-strewn
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The horrors of the night,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;the dead
and dying below, the ship scarcely floating, the swelling
waves threatening each moment to engulf her, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
wild howling of the storm, and the iron-bound coast
of Bretagne to leeward, were all together such as to
try severely the courage of the few remaining officers
and men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At daybreak, however, the wind went down; we
found ourselves near the Breton coast; and, upon
our firing guns and making signals of distress, a number
of boats came to our assistance. In this manner
was the <i>St. Jacques</i> taken into Port Louis, followed in
the course of the day by the three Dutch ships-of-war,
twelve of the merchant ships, the <i>Lenore</i>, and
the two St. Malo privateers. The <i>Sans-Pareil</i> did not
get in till the next day, after having been twenty times
upon the point of perishing by fire and tempest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus ended the great fight of R&eacute;nee Du Guay-Trouin,
whose blood, you see, was quite as blue as
his breeches.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>&ldquo;Again,&rdquo; wrote His Majesty the King, &ldquo;do I offer
you a commission in the Royal Navy, Du Guay-Trouin.
Will you accept? This time it is a Captaincy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied little R&eacute;nee,&mdash;quite simply&mdash;and,
at the next dinner of the officers of the Royal Marines,
they sang a chorus, which ran:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Oh, yes, he&rsquo;s only a Democrat, his blood is hardly blue,<br /></span>

</div>

<p class="author">&mdash;<i>Log of the Royal James.</i></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>IT him with a bottle, he deserves it, th&rsquo;
brute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man who spoke was a thick-set sailor
of some forty-five summers, with a swarthy skin, a
brownish mat of hair, a hard visage, and a cut across
one eye. He stood upon the deck of a good-sized
brig, which was drowsily lolling along the coast of
Africa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he treated us like dogs aboard th&rsquo; <i>Cuttlefish</i>.
Here, give me a shot at &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus cried another sailor&mdash;a toughish customer
also&mdash;and, as his voice rang out, a dozen more came
running to the spot.</p>

<p>Cringing before the evil gaze of the seamen stood
the Captain of a Bristol merchantman&mdash;the <i>Cadogan</i>&mdash;which
lay a boat&rsquo;s length away, upon the glassy
surface of a rocking sea.</p>

<p>Again rang out the harsh tones of him who had
first spoken.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ah, Captain Skinner, it is you, eh? You are the
very person I wished to see. I am much in your debt,
and I shall pay you in your own coin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor Captain trembled in every joint, and said,
with a curious chattering of his teeth,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Edward England, you&rsquo;ve got me now. But
go easy like, will yer? I always was a friend o&rsquo;
yourn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yer didn&rsquo;t look like a friend on th&rsquo; old <i>Jamaica</i>,
when you refused to pay me my wages,&rdquo; interrupted
the first speaker. &ldquo;Yer didn&rsquo;t remove me to &rsquo;er cursed
man-o&rsquo;-warsman, did yer? Yer didn&rsquo;t see that I got
th&rsquo; cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails on my back, did yer? Now,
Mr. Skinner, it&rsquo;s my chance ter get even. Tie
him ter th&rsquo; windlass, boys, and we&rsquo;ll fix th&rsquo; feller&rsquo;s
hash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a jeering laugh the sailors seized the frightened
man, roped him tightly to the desired prop, and,
procuring a lot of glass bottles, pelted him with them
until their arms were tired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wuz a good master to me, Captain Skinner,&rdquo;
cried one. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; a dose of your own
medicine. Overboard with him, Boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, suiting the action to the words, he seized him
by the collar. The ropes were unwound. The poor
wretch was dragged to the rail, and, as his body spun
out into the oily sea, a shot ended the life of poor
Thomas Skinner of the <i>Cadogan</i> from Bristol. Captain
Edward England and his men had had a sweet
and sure revenge.</p>

<p>Where this reckless mariner was born, it is difficult
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
to ascertain. We know that he started life honestly
enough, for he was mate of a sloop that sailed
from Jamaica, about the year 1715, and was taken
by a pirate called Captain Winter. The youthful
sailor soon took up the careless ways of his captors,
and it was not many years before he became Captain
of his own vessel: a sloop flying the black flag with
a skull and cross-bones.</p>

<p>Off the east coast of Africa he soon took a ship
called the <i>Pearl</i>, for which he exchanged his own
sloop, fitting the new vessel up for piratical service,
after rechristening her the <i>Royal James</i>. Cruising
about in this staunch craft, he captured several ships
of different sizes and flying the flags of many nations.
He was rich and prosperous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said one of his reckless followers, at
this time, &ldquo;man-o&rsquo;-warsmen are gettin&rsquo; too thick in
these parts for an honest sailor. Let&rsquo;s get across th&rsquo;
pond to th&rsquo; Brazilian coast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right,&rdquo; answered England. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got to look for other pickings. After we provision-up,
we&rsquo;ll sail towards th&rsquo; setting sun. That&rsquo;s a fresh field
and we can have it to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So all made ready for a trans-Atlantic voyage.</p>

<p>But Captain England was in error when he said
that he was sailing for fields which had never before
been touched. Two other piratical vessels: the <i>Revenge</i>
and the <i>Flying King</i>, had been cruising off the
coast of Brazil, just before his advent. Fighting in
partnership, they had taken two Portuguese schooners,
and were making off with them, when a Portuguese
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
man-o&rsquo;-warsman came booming along under full canvas.
She was an unwelcome guest.</p>

<p>Setting all sail the two pirates had attempted to
get away and the <i>Revenge</i> succeeded in doing so.
Two days later a typhoon struck her and she was
soon swinging bottom upwards, with the kittiwakes
shrieking over her barnacled keel.</p>

<p>But the revengeful man-o&rsquo;-warsman ploughed relentlessly
after the <i>Flying King</i>, which could not fly
quite fast enough, this time, and&mdash;in despair&mdash;was
run, bows on, upon the shore, where the crew scrambled
to the sand in a desperate endeavor to get away.
The sailors from the man-o&rsquo;-warsman were speedy;
they shot twelve of the buccaneers, took the rest
prisoners (there were seventy in all) and hanged
thirty-eight to the yard-arm. News of this came to
Captain England when he neared the tropic coast of
Brazil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in a life-time,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m captured,
of course I&rsquo;ll swing. But, meanwhile, I hope to have
a good life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not many days afterwards he heard the welcome
sound of:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sail ho! Off the port bow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And raising the glass to his eye discovered
two fat, prosperous-looking merchant ships, slipping
quietly along like an old maid fresh from market.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slap on all sail and give chase!&rdquo; was bellowed
out in stentorian tones, and the <i>Royal James</i> was
soon fairly boiling along with every stitch aloft, which
she could carry.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
As she neared the merchantmen, the names came
plainly to view: the <i>Peterborough</i> of Bristol, and the
<i>Victory</i> of Liverpool, but a shot screamed across the
bowsprit of the latter and victory was turned into
defeat. A white flag was fluttering at her mainmast
in a moment, for the Captain had no stomach for a
fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egad, it&rsquo;s a pirate,&rdquo; said the good seaman in
despair, as the black flag with the skull and cross-bones
fluttered from the rigging of his capturer. &ldquo;I
thought she was a privateersman under Letters of
Marque. It&rsquo;s all up with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the boat-load of boarders came bobbing alongside
he cried out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy! Have mercy upon the souls of these poor
wretches who sail with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pirates guffawed, helped themselves to everything
of value, and took the merchantmen with them
to the coast of Brazil, where the crew were allowed
to escape to the shore. The <i>Peterborough</i> was re-christened
the <i>Victory</i> and was manned by half of
England&rsquo;s crew, while the other vessel was burned at
night; the pirates dancing on the beach to the light
of the flames and singing the weird songs of the sea.</p>

<p>Now there was a scene of wild revel upon the Brazilian
coast; but the natives grew angry at the conduct
of these rough men of the ocean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; spoke a chief, &ldquo;we must drive them away,
else they will burn our own villages as they did their
houses upon the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One peaceful evening the followers of Captain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
England were hard beset by fully a thousand black-skinned
warriors from the Brazilian jungle.</p>

<p>There was a fierce battle. The negroes were pressed
back upon their principal town and were driven
through it on the run, for their arrows and spears
were not as effective as the guns and pistols of the
English, Dutch, Spaniards and Portuguese, who had
adopted a piratical career. Their thatched huts were
set on fire, and, satisfied with the day&rsquo;s work, the
pirates retired to their ships, where a vote was cast
where was to be their next venture. It fell to the
East Indies and the Island of Madagascar. So they
set sail, singing an old ballad which ran,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Heave the lead and splice th&rsquo; topsail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tie her down, and let her fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We&rsquo;re agoin&rsquo; to Madagascar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where th&rsquo; little tom-tits trill,<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Bill an&rsquo; coo, an&rsquo; sing so sweetly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In th&rsquo; dronin&rsquo; hours of noon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you want to die there, neatly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just drop off into &rsquo;er swoon.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The voyage across was a good one and the pirates
captured two East Indiamen and a Dutchman, bound
to Bombay. These they exchanged for one of their
own vessels, and then set out for Madagascar Island,
where several of their hands were set ashore with
tents and ammunition, to kill such beasts and venison
as the place afforded.</p>

<p>Then they sailed for the Isle of Juanna,&mdash;not a
great distance from Madagascar,&mdash;and here had as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
keen a little engagement as ever employed a piratical
crew. Hear the story of this fight in the words of
Captain Mackra, an English sea-captain who happened
at that time to be in the harbor.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="address">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Bombay</span>, November 16th, 1720.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We arrived on the 25th of July last, in company
with the <i>Greenwich</i>, at Juanna, an island not far from
Madagascar. Putting in there to refresh our men,
we found fourteen pirates who came in their canoes
from the Mayotta (island) where the pirate ship to
which they belonged, the <i>Indian Queen</i>&mdash;two hundred
and fifty tons, twenty-eight guns, commanded by
Captain Oliver de la Bouche, bound from the Guinea
coast to the East Indies&mdash;had been bulged (run
ashore) and lost. They said they left the Captain
and forty men building a new vessel, to proceed upon
their wicked designs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Kirby and I concluding that it might be
of great service to the East India Company to destroy
such a nest of rogues, were ready to sail for this
purpose on the 17th of August, about eight o&rsquo;clock
in the morning, when we discovered two pirates standing
into the Bay of Juanna, one of thirty-four and
the other of thirty-six guns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I immediately went on board the <i>Greenwich</i> where
they seemed very diligent in preparation for an engagement,
and I left Captain Kirby with mutual
understanding of standing by each other. I then unmoored,
got under sail, and brought two boats ahead
to row me close to the <i>Greenwich</i>; but he being open
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
to a breeze, made the best of his way from me; which
an Ostender in our company of twenty-two guns,
seeing, did the same, though the Captain had promised
heartily to engage with us, and, I believe would
have been as good as his word, if Captain Kirby had
kept his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About half an hour after twelve, I called several
times to the <i>Greenwich</i> to bear down to our assistance,
and fired a shot at him, but to no purpose; for, though
we did not doubt but he would join us, because, when
he got about a league from us he brought his ship
to and looked on; yet both he and the Ostender basely
deserted us, and left us engaged with barbarous and
inhuman enemies, with their black and bloody flags
hanging over us, without the least appearance of ever
escaping, but to be cut to pieces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But God in his good providence, determined
otherwise; for, notwithstanding their superiority, we
engaged them both about three hours, during which
time the biggest of them received some shot betwixt
wind and water, which made her keep a little off, to
stop her leaks. The other endeavored all she could
to board us, by rowing with her oars, being within
half a ship&rsquo;s length of us about an hour; but, by good
fortune, we shot all her oars to pieces, which prevented
them from getting in close, and consequently saved our
lives.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;LEFT US ENGAGED WITH BARBAROUS AND INHUMAN ENEMIES.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;About four o&rsquo;clock most of the officers and men
posted on the quarter-deck being killed and wounded,
the largest ship made up to us with diligence, after
giving us a broadside. There now being no hopes of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
Captain Kirby&rsquo;s coming to our assistance, we endeavored
to run ashore; and though we drew four feet
of water more than the pirate, it pleased God that he
stuck fast on a higher ground than happily we fell in
with; so was disappointed a second time from boarding
us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we had a more violent engagement than
before. All of my officers and most of my men behaved
with unexpected courage; and, as we had a
considerable advantage by having a chance to hurl a
broadside into his bow, we did him great damage.
Had Captain Kirby come in then, I believe we should
have taken both the vessels, for we had one of them,
sure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other pirate (who was still firing at us) seeing
the <i>Greenwich</i> did not offer to assist us, supplied
his consort with three boats full of fresh men. About
five in the evening the <i>Greenwich</i> stood clear away to
sea, leaving us struggling hard for life, in the very
jaws of death; which the other pirate that was afloat,
seeing, got a hawser out, and began to haul under our
stern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By this time many of my men were being killed
and wounded, and no hopes left us of escaping being
all murdered by enraged barbarous conquerors, I ordered
all that could to get into the long-boat, under
the cover of the smoke from our guns; so that, with
what some did in boats, and others by swimming, most
of us that were able got ashore by seven o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the pirates came aboard, they cut three of
our wounded men to pieces. I, with some of my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
people, made what haste I could to Kings-town,
twenty-five miles from us; where I arrived next day,
almost dead with the fatigue and loss of blood, having
been sorely wounded in the head by a musket-ball.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At this town I heard that the pirates had offered
ten thousand dollars to the country people to bring
me in, which many of them would have accepted, only
they knew that the king and all his chief people were
in my interest. Meanwhile I caused a report to be
circulated that I was dead of my wounds, which much
abated their fury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had, in all, thirteen killed and twenty-four
wounded; and we were told that we destroyed about
ninety, or a hundred, of the pirates. I am persuaded
that, had our consort the <i>Greenwich</i> done her duty,
we could have destroyed both of them, and got two
hundred thousand pounds ($1,000,000.00) for our
owners and ourselves.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>What say you to this fight? And to think that our
own good friend Captain Mackra just missed being
a millionaire! Weep for the gallant sea warrior!</p>

<p>At any rate he got safely away, for, at length going
aboard one of the piratical vessels,&mdash;under a flag
of truce&mdash;he discovered that several of the wild sea-robbers
knew him; some of them&mdash;even&mdash;had
sailed with him in earlier years.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found this to be of great advantage,&rdquo; he writes.
&ldquo;For, notwithstanding their promise not to harm me,
some of them would have cut me to pieces, had it not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
been for their chief, Captain Edward England, and
some others whom I knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he used his powers of persuasion to such effect
that: &ldquo;They made me a present of the shattered ship&mdash;which
was Dutch built&mdash;called the <i>Fancy</i>, her
burden being about three hundred tons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With jury-masts, and such other old sails as they
left me, I set sail on September 8th, with forty-three
of my ship&rsquo;s crew, including two passengers and
twelve soldiers. After a passage of forty-eight days
I arrived at Bombay on the 26th of October, almost
naked and starved, having been reduced to a pint of
water a day, and almost in despair of ever seeing
land, by reason of the calms we met with between the
coast of Arabia and Malabar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gallant writer of this interesting description
was certainly in imminent danger of his life, when he
trusted himself upon the pirate ship, and unquestionably
nothing could have justified such a hazardous
step but the desperate circumstances in which he was
placed. The honor and influence of Captain England,
however, protected him and his men from the wrath
of the crew, who would willingly have wreaked their
vengeance upon those who had dealt them such heavy
blows in the recent fight.</p>

<p>But the generosity of Captain England toward the
unfortunate Mackra proved to be calamitous to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are no true pirate,&rdquo; cried one of his crew.
&ldquo;For a buccaneer never allows his foes to get away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; shouted others. &ldquo;This fighting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
Mackra will soon come against us with a strong force.
You did wrong in letting him escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the yard-arm with the traitor!&rdquo; sounded from
the throat of many a ruffianly seaman.</p>

<p>Thus grew the feeling of mutiny&mdash;and the result
of these murmurs of discontent&mdash;was that Captain
England was put ashore by the cruel villains; and,
with three others was marooned upon the island of
Mauritius. Had they not been destitute of every
necessity they might have been able to live in comfort,
for the island abounds in deer, hogs, and other animals.
Dissatisfied, however, with this solitary situation,
Captain England and his three men exerted their
industry and ingenuity, built a small boat, and sailed
to Madagascar, where they lived upon the generosity
of some more fortunate piratical companions.</p>

<p>But can a pirate remain happy when not pirating?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Away with this life,&rdquo; cried Captain England. &ldquo;I
pine for more treasure and for battle. Let&rsquo;s out and
to sea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Good!&rdquo; said his mates. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ship
aboard another vessel and get away from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, they again took to the ocean, but what became
of Edward England is not known.</p>

<p>Some say that he was killed in a brawl; some that
he was again marooned and was adopted by a savage
tribe; some that he perished in a fight upon the Indian
Ocean. At any rate that rough and valiant soul
is lost to history, and&mdash;somewhere&mdash;in the vast
solitude of the Southern Hemisphere, lie the bleaching
bones of him who had flaunted the skull-and-cross-bones
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
upon the wide highway of the gleaming wastes
of salty brine. His was a rough and careless life.
Do not emulate the career of Edward England!</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ES, you can have the <i>Duke</i> and the <i>Duchess</i>.
They are both staunch craft and we expect
to get a good return for our investment in
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fellow who spoke&mdash;a stout-bodied Quaker&mdash;looked
quizzically at a bronzed sea-captain, who, cap
in hand, stood before him. By his side were seated
a number of merchants, fat, sleek, contented-looking.
They were giving instructions to Captain Woodes
Rogers: their privateersman, who was about to make
a voyage of adventure in their behalf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My good friends,&rdquo; said the mariner, &ldquo;I shall do
my very best for you all. The French and Spaniards
have been having it all their own way in the South
seas. It is about time that the English had a share in
the rich spoils of that treasure highway. I shall work
my hardest for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
The merchants, ship-owners and Quakers nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May Providence guide your course aright,&rdquo; said
they. And&mdash;as Captain Woodes Rogers went off to
inspect his privateersmen&mdash;all indulged in a glass of
Madeira to pledge &ldquo;good luck and good health&rdquo; to the
staunch seaman from Bristol.</p>

<p>It was not many weeks before the <i>Duke</i> (of three
hundred and twenty tons) with thirty guns and one
hundred and seventeen men, and the <i>Duchess</i> (of two
hundred and sixty tons) with twenty-six guns and one
hundred and eight men, sailed from King Road for
Cork, in Ireland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egad!&rdquo; cried Captain Rogers, as they passed out
to sea. &ldquo;Our rigging is slack. Our decks are
lumbered up. Our stores are badly stowed. Our crew
is so very mixed that I must stop in Ireland to get more
able sea-dogs. Was ever captain in a worse fix?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His Lieutenants grinned, for they saw that things
were in a sorry mess, indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of us have embraced this trip around the
world in order to retrieve our fortunes,&rdquo; continued
the captain. &ldquo;Did you ever see a harder crew than
this? There are tinkers, tailors, haymakers, peddlers,
fiddlers, a negro and ten boys. None know how to use
the cutlass and they haven&rsquo;t got any sea-legs. Well,
well; I&rsquo;ll make the best of it, but it&rsquo;s hard goin&rsquo;, I
assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And still the Lieutenants grinned.</p>

<p>They grinned still more when they had lain a few
days at Cork, for the crew were continually marrying,
although they expected to sail immediately. However,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
as the two privateers got under way on September 1st,&mdash;with
the <i>Hastings</i>, a man-of-war&mdash;the majority of
the crew drank a health to their spouses; waved their
hands to them over the rail; and &ldquo;parted unconcerned.&rdquo;
Truly, a sailor has a lass in every port.</p>

<p>Not many days after their out-going, a sail was
sighted and all speed was made to capture her. The
Swedish colors fluttered from her mast-head, and she
hove to at the first gun. Rogers boarded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No contraband goods are here,&rdquo; said he, after
looking into the hold. &ldquo;We must let her off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then&mdash;turning to her captain&mdash;he said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can go. I am not a pirate&mdash;but a privateer&mdash;sailing
under Letters of Marque. I only seize goods
that are contraband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bobbing and courtesying on the waves, the little
Swede soon drifted from view.</p>

<p>But the crew grew mutinous,&mdash;for had they not
come out for plunder? The boatswain even called
Rogers a traitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seize the fellow and flog him,&rdquo; cried the sturdy
captain. &ldquo;Put ten of these talkative hounds in irons.
We&rsquo;ll do the talking on this boat, and the sailors must
do theirs in the fo&rsquo;castle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was done immediately.</p>

<p>Next day a seaman came aft, with near half the
ship&rsquo;s company in his rear, and cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I demand the boatswain out of his irons, Captain
Rogers. He&rsquo;s done nothing to deserve such a severe
punishment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak with me privately, on the quarter-deck,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
said the bluff commander. &ldquo;I cannot discuss this
matter with you in such a crowd.&rdquo; And he moved aft.</p>

<p>The grumbler followed, but, no sooner was he alone
with stout Woodes, than the captain sprang upon him
with the agility of a leopard. He was thrown to the
ground, held, and bound by two officers. Then he was
stripped and whipped until the blood ran.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This method,&rdquo; writes the doughty Woodes, &ldquo;I
deemed best for breaking any unlawful friendship
among the mutinous crew. It allayed the tumult, so
that they began to submit quietly and those in irons
begged my pardon, and promised amendment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the captain had won the first round with the
mutineers.</p>

<p>Now, know you, that the War of the Spanish Succession
was then in progress; a war in which one party
was endeavoring to put the Archduke Charles of Austria
upon the Spanish throne; another to place Philip,
grandson of Louis XIV of France, in the chair of the
rulers. And when&mdash;a few days later&mdash;the two privateers
captured a small Spanish vessel, they found that
their possession of it was disputed, when they sailed
into the Canaries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been agreed between Queen Anne of England
and the Kings of Spain and France,&rdquo; said the
Vice-Consul of that place&mdash;an Englishman&mdash;&ldquo;that
all vessels trading to the Canary Isles shall be exempt
from interference by men-o&rsquo;-war, or privateers. The
prize must be released. If you do not do so, we will
keep your agent, Mr. Vanbrugh, who has come ashore,
and will throw him into irons.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
But the Vice-Consul had reckoned without his host.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are apprehensive that you are obliged to give
us this advice in order to gratify the Spaniards,&rdquo; wrote
Captain Rogers. &ldquo;If you do not allow my agent to
come on board my ship, you may expect a visit from
my guns at eight o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this there was no reply.</p>

<p>Next day the two English privateers stood in close
to shore, and, just as the shot was rammed home, a
boat put off, in the stern of which sat Mr. Vanbrugh
with a present of wine, grapes, hogs and jelly. The
prize which had been captured was sent back to Bristol
with a picked crew.</p>

<p>The two sea-rovers bore towards the South&mdash;soon
crossed the Tropic of Cancer&mdash;and there had appropriate
ceremonies for the occasion. The tinkers, peddlers,
fiddlers, and tailors who made up the crew, were
each and all hoisted overboard by a rope. A stick
was placed between their legs and they were ducked
again and again in the brine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If any man wants to get off,&rdquo; spoke Captain
Rogers, &ldquo;he can do so by paying me a half-a-sovereign
($2.50) which must be expended on an entertainment
for the rest of the company when England shall be
reached. Every man that is ducked is paid in proportion
to the number of times that he goes under.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several accepted this offer. At which a sailor cried out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Duck me twelve times, Captain. I want to have
a regular orgy when I get back home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the sailors did it, laughing uproariously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
Sailing to the Cape Verde Islands, the <i>Duke</i> and the
<i>Duchess</i> anchored in the harbor of St. Vincent, where
one of the crew, who was a good linguist (Joseph
Alexander) was sent in a boat to the Governor, at
San Antonio, in order to negotiate for supplies. He
seemed to prefer Cape Verde to privateering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On October 6th,&rdquo; writes the gallant Rogers, &ldquo;our
boat went to San Antonio to get our linguist, according
to appointment. No news of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On October 6th, our boat returned with nothing
but limes and tobacco. No news of our linguist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On October 7th, no news of our linguist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the 8th, boat sent ashore, but no news of our
linguist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the 9th, as the trade-winds are blowing fresh,
concluded to leave our good Alexander to practice his
linguistic and other accomplishments ashore. Adieu
to our linguist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus disappeared the sleek and crafty Joseph.</p>

<p>There was still trouble from insubordination, for
Mr. Page&mdash;second mate of the <i>Duchess</i>&mdash;refused
to accompany Mr. Cook (second in command on the
<i>Duke</i>). Whereupon the hot-tempered Captain Cook&mdash;being
the superior officer on board&mdash;struck him,
and several blows were interchanged.</p>

<p>At last Page was forced into the boat and brought
to the <i>Duke</i>, where he was ordered to the forecastle in
the bilboes (leg irons sliding upon a long, iron bar).
But he jumped overboard&mdash;despising the chance of
being gobbled up by a shark&mdash;and started to swim
to his own ship. He was brought back, flogged, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span>
put in irons; and he evidently found a week of this
kind of thing sufficient; for he submitted himself
humbly to future orders.</p>

<p>Thus Woodes Rogers had already learned that the
life of a privateer commander was not a happy one.</p>

<p>Steering southwest, a large French ship was seen
and chased, but she got away from the two consorts
with surprising ease. On March 6th, when off the
coast of Peru, a sail was sighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the <i>Duchess</i> bear down on her port and the
<i>Duke</i> to starboard,&rdquo; cried Captain Rogers. &ldquo;Heave
a solid shot across her bow, and, if she refuses to
capitulate, let her have your broadsides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dipping, tossing, rolling; the two privateers
swooped down upon their prey, like hawks. She
flew the yellow flag of Spain&mdash;and&mdash;as the first
ball of lead cut across her bowsprit, it fluttered to the
deck. Up went a white shirt, tied to a rat-line, and
the crew from the <i>Duke</i> was soon in charge, and steering
her for Lobas: a harbor on the coast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a tight little barque,&rdquo; said Rogers, when
he had landed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make her into a privateer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she was hauled up, cleaned, launched, and
christened the <i>Beginning</i>; with a spare topmast
from the <i>Duke</i> as a mast, and an odd mizzen-topsail
altered for a sail. Four swivel-guns were mounted
upon her deck, and, as she pounded out of the bay,
loud cheers greeted her from the decks of the <i>Duchess</i>,
which was loafing outside, watching for a merchantman
to capture and pillage.</p>

<p>Next morn two sails were sighted, and both <i>Duke</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
and <i>Duchess</i> hastened to make another haul. As they
neared them, one was seen to be a stout cruiser from
Lima; the other a French-built barque from Panama;
richly laden, it was thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Broadsides for both,&rdquo; ordered Woodes Rogers.
&ldquo;Broadsides and good treatment when the white flag
flutters aloft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the <i>Duchess</i> chased the Lima boat, the <i>Duke</i>
neared the Frenchman and spanked a shot at her from
a bow-gun. The sea ran high and she did not wish to
get too close and board, because it would be easier to
send her men in pinnaces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re afraid!&rdquo; cried the Captain of the <i>Duke</i>.
&ldquo;We can take &rsquo;em with no exertion.&rdquo; But he was
like many an Englishman: despised his foe only to
find him a valiant one.</p>

<p>Piling into four boats, the men from the <i>Duke</i>, fully
armed, rowed swiftly towards the rolling Frenchman.
They approached to within twenty yards. Then</p>

<p><em>Crash! Crash! Rattle! Crash!</em></p>

<p>A sheet of flame burst from her sides; muskets and
pistols spoke; cannon spat grape and cannister; the
Englishmen were frightfully cut up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On! On!&rdquo; shouted young John Rogers&mdash;a
brother of Woodes&mdash;as he waved his cutlass aloft
to enliven the sailors. But it was his last cry. A
bullet struck him in the forehead, and he fell into the
sea without a murmur.</p>

<p><em>Crash! Crash!</em></p>

<p>Again roared out a volley. Oars were splintered.
One boat was pierced below the water line. She sank,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span>
and her men floundered about upon the surface of the
oily sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bear off, and rescue our comrades!&rdquo; cried the
leaders of this futile attack, and, as the French barque
drifted away, the remaining boats busied themselves
with the swimming sailors. The assault had been a
complete failure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curses upon the Frenchman!&rdquo; cried Captain
Rogers when he saw the saucy fighter drawing off.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go after her to-morrow, and catch her, or my
blood&rsquo;s not English. What say you, men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. After her and board her amid-ships!&rdquo; cried
all. &ldquo;Run our own vessel alongside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that I will do,&rdquo; answered Rogers, watching
the lumbering merchantman through his glass. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
entirely too well armed for a trader.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When morning dawned, the Frenchman was still
ploughing along the coast in the light breeze, with all
sail set. But there was not wind enough to force her
ahead of her pursuer. The <i>Duchess</i> now returned
from her chase of the Lima boat, and, joining her
<i>Duke</i>, bore in upon the able fighter from the open sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egad! We&rsquo;ll have her yet,&rdquo; shouted Captain
Rogers, rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She luffs!&rdquo; cried a lieutenant. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming
to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough the Frenchman saw that resistance
now was useless. She staggered into the wind, and a
white flag beckoned for a prize-crew to come and take
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; writes Captain Rogers, &ldquo;I found that a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
Bishop who had been aboard of her, had been put
ashore, which gave me much grief. For I always love
to catch fat prelates, as they give up a stout sum as
their ransom. In truth they are nice pickings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Things were going well with the wild rovers from
Bristol. Plunder there was aplenty and the holds of
the <i>Duke</i> and the <i>Duchess</i> bulged with treasure. Yet
Woodes Rogers was not satisfied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On! On to Guayaquil!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll capture
this wealthy city; demand a great ransom; and
sail to England, richer than the Spanish conquerors of
the Incas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted his staunch followers. &ldquo;On!
On! to Guayaquil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So&mdash;steering for the coast of Ecuador&mdash;the privateers
drew near this rich Spanish-American town. A
gulf lay before their eyes in which was a small island;
with a little, white-housed village (called Puna) on its
Eastern shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the place!&rdquo; cried Rogers, as the two ships
forged into the sleepy shallows, and rounded to before
the peaceful habitation.</p>

<p>With a cheer, the sailors piled into the boats, rowed
ashore, and&mdash;with cutlass and dirk in hand&mdash;pressed
through the narrow streets. Shots rang out from a few
of the thatched houses; two seamen fell to the ground
with mortal wounds; but, cheering wildly, the privateers
rushed through the narrow highway; pressed
into the court-house; and seized upon the Lieutenant-Governor
of the town of Guayaquil, as he was attempting
to hide behind an old clothes-press.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
&ldquo;Let no man get away in order to warn the large
town of our approach!&rdquo; shouted Captain Rogers.
&ldquo;Catch all who dash for the canoes upon the beach!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crush the bloomin&rsquo; canoes!&rdquo; yelled Cook, as he
saw some of the natives running towards them on the
sandy shore. &ldquo;Crush the canoes before the devils
can get there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; answered several of his men, as they
ran for the clusters of boats. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put holes in
them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they hurried forward, several of the natives were
ahead. Two jumped into the bark boats and paddled
furiously for Guayaquil. The <em>zip</em>, <em>zip</em> of bullets nipped
the water around them, but,&mdash;with desperate sweeps&mdash;they
dug their blades into the sea and got safely
off. As a result, the city was all ready and prepared
for the invaders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! Ho!&rdquo; laughed Rogers, as he thumbed the
papers of the Lieutenant-Governor. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A warning to the townsfolk of Guayaquil,&rdquo; said
one of his men, as he peered over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Rogers chuckled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beware, all you people&rdquo;&mdash;he read&mdash;&ldquo;of a
squadron from the faraway isles of Great Britain
which is coming shortly upon you. There will be full
ten great ships, heavily manned and well armed for
attack. The arch rogue, William Dampier, will be in
control,&mdash;he who has plundered Puna before. Be
on your guard, citizens! Be prepared! Arm yourselves!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hah! Hah!&rdquo; laughed the free-booting captain.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
&ldquo;They think I&rsquo;m Dampier. That&rsquo;s good. But we&rsquo;ll
have a tough time with them, for they know that we
mean to assault their pretty little town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His followers looked solemn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s attack, right away,&rdquo; cried several, &ldquo;before
the Spaniards have time to prepare for our charge!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rogers, however, would not hear of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must rest. Equip ourselves. Place cannon
in the bows of our boats, and then we will be ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His men murmured, but they knew that when
Rogers had made up his mind upon a thing, there was
no use in endeavoring to dissuade him. So they collected
what plunder was to be had and awaited his
further orders.</p>

<p>Two days later all was ready for the advance. It
was near midnight&mdash;upon April 22nd,&mdash;when the
command was passed around:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Muffle your oars and take the town!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With one hundred and ten men in the jolly boats, the
privateers neared the sleepy, little seaport. Not a
sound broke the silence, save the drip, drip of the
sweeps, yet, as they approached the white-washed walls
of the lower town,&mdash;a bonfire was touched off upon
the shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well,&rdquo; whispered a stout sailor. &ldquo;Now we
can see to shoot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he said this, many lights appeared in the houses
of Guayaquil. The townspeople were wide awake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What means this, sirrah?&rdquo; thundered Rogers at
a native guide, who was piloting him to the shore.</p>

<p>The fellow had a ready answer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the celebration of All Saints Day,&rdquo; he answered
smiling. &ldquo;The people here are good Christians.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They know that we are coming,&rdquo; growled the
English captain, for, as the native spoke, a Spaniard
upon the shore was heard to shout:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Puna has been captured! The enemy is advancing!
Arm! Arm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bells clanged from the steeples of the little churches.
Muskets and guns went off. Black masses could be
seen surging into the streets. Cannon roared, and a
screeching shot spun ahead of the on-coming boats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis nothing,&rdquo; said Rogers. &ldquo;The alarm has only
just been given. Preparations are not complete and
we can rush them, easily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Captain Cook had his own opinion upon the
affair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Buccaneers,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;never attack any large
place after it is alarmed. My advice is to keep away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go in,&rdquo; cried several. &ldquo;Wait and rush
them when they are not so well prepared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even the men seemed disinclined to advance.</p>

<p>Thus cautious counsel prevailed: the boats dropped
down-stream again&mdash;about three miles below the
town&mdash;and were joined by two small barques. They
were prizes which had been recently captured. Here
the flotilla lay while the cries in the city grew inaudible,&mdash;for
the inhabitants saw that the attack had
been avoided.</p>

<p>When flood-tide came, Captain Rogers once more
ordered an advance upon the town.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>
&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; argued Dover. &ldquo;They are too well
prepared. Night will cloak our movements, so we
should then go on. I, myself, advise the sending of
a trumpeter with a flag of truce. He shall propose
that we make some trades with the people of this
place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your measure is half-hearted,&rdquo; said Rogers, with
heat. &ldquo;You are a craven knave. Let&rsquo;s rush the town
like Englishmen and heroes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again cautious counsel prevailed. Two prisoners&mdash;a
Lieutenant from Puna, and the Captain of the
Frenchman of recent capture&mdash;were sent to parley
with the Spaniards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The English are afraid!&rdquo; whispered the inhabitants.
&ldquo;Let us keep them off with braggadocio, and
mayhap reinforcements will come to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they bickered and delayed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These dogs would palaver forever,&rdquo; said Captain
Rogers, when negotiations had proceeded for full two
days without result. &ldquo;I, for one, am for attacking
the city right now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes! On! On!&rdquo; cried his men.</p>

<p>Even the cautious Dover was ready to advance;
so, landing upon the beach, the one hundred and
ten ran towards the town with a wild, exultant
whoop!</p>

<p><em>Zip! Zip!</em> came the bullets from the nearer houses,
as the privateers advanced.</p>

<p><em>Boom! Boom!</em> sounded the guns from the <i>Duchess</i>
and the <i>Duke</i>, which had edged up near the wharves
and anchored. Shells shrieked and burst; guns
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg&nbsp;169]</a></span>
roared; and, with a hoarse cheer, the English beat
down two lines of Spaniards who opposed them.</p>

<p>Back, back, they crushed the defenders of Guayaquil
to the market-place in the centre of the town, where
four cannon were drawn up behind a barricade which
was flanked by cavalry.</p>

<p><em>Crash! Crash!</em> they roared at the on-coming privateers,
and many a man went down before the
exploding grape and cannister. But the blood of the
English was now up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the guns!&rdquo; shouted Woodes Rogers.
&ldquo;Scale the barricade and spike the pieces!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a mighty roar the jack-tars ran for the engines
of death; leaping over the wall of the defenses;
bayonetting the gunners; turning the spitting war-engines
upon the cavalry, which, in confusion and dismay,
was driven down a crooked lane. It was the last
stand. The English standard soon waved from the
flag-pole of the House of Justice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; cried Captain Rogers, gleefully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
meet the worthy <i>Padres</i> and treat with them for a
ransom. We&rsquo;ll make them pay full well to get back
the neat little town of Guayaquil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crestfallen and abashed, the city fathers were soon
brought before the privateer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;your men can fight like devils.
Se&ntilde;or, you are the first man to have taken our town,
and many a Buccaneer has endeavored to do so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Rogers smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut! Tut!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The English can always
battle. But&mdash;Fathers&mdash;you must pay me well for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span>
this affair. I demand thirty thousand pieces of eight
($35,000 or about &pound;6,750) as ransom for your fair
city. I will give you two days in which to collect it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The worthy <i>Padres</i> hung their heads.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You English,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;are cruel extortioners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;in two day&rsquo;s time&mdash;the British marched to
their boats with colors flying, bugles blowing, and
drums beating a rollicking tattoo. Captain Rogers
brought up the rear with a few men. He had secured
the ransom and fairly smiled with exuberant joy.
&ldquo;Our sailors,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;kept continually dropping
their pistols, cutlasses, and pole-axes; which shows
they had grown careless and very weak&mdash;weary of
being soldiers&mdash;and it was high time that we should
be gone from hence to the shores of Merrie England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus, on April 28th, when the <i>Duke</i> and the <i>Duchess</i>
weighed anchor and stood out to sea: guns roared:
trumpets blew: the men cheered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; writes the gallant Rogers, &ldquo;we took leave
of the Spaniards very cheerfully, but not half so well
pleased as we should have been if we had taken &rsquo;em by
surprise; for I was well assured from all hands, that
at least we should then have got about two hundred
thousand pieces of eight in money (&pound;45,000 or
$225,000); and in jewels, diamonds, and wrought
and unwrought gold and silver.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The owners of the two privateers: the <i>Duke</i> and the
<i>Duchess</i>, sat in solemn meeting at the good town of
Bristol. It was the month of October, 1711.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg&nbsp;171]</a></span>
The fat Quakers were smiling, for Captain Rogers
had brought them back equally fat moneys.</p>

<p>The rugged merchants laughed, for the venture had
been a howling success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you were wounded?&rdquo; said a stockholder,
turning to the bronzed sea-rover who stood before
them, giving account and reckoning of his journey
to the Spanish Main.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A scratch,&rdquo; replied the stout sea-dog, smiling.
&ldquo;When we tackled a Manila ship on the way home
from Guayaquil, I got a ball through the jaw, and a
splinter in the left foot. It laid me up for full three
weeks, but, gentlemen, a cat and Woodes Rogers both
have nine lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And even the sober Quaker fathers laughed at this
sally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done well,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;We will reward
you with money and a good berth. How would you
care to be Governor of the Bahamas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; said Woodes Rogers, chuckling.</p>

<p>And that is the way the old sea-barnacle spent his
declining years, dying at the tropic isle on July 16th,
1732. Hail to this Prince of Privateers!</p>

<p class="author">&mdash;<i>Chants of the Eastern Clipper Ships.</i>&mdash;1846.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the year 1744 war was declared between England
and France. French privateers harried the
coast of her rival, caught her merchantmen whenever
they ventured away from stout men-o&rsquo;-warsmen,
and chased them in the blue, shimmering waters of
the Mediterranean. It seemed as if there were never
gun-boats enough to protect the British shipping, and
thus many of the English merchants grew choleric and
angry.</p>

<p>Englishmen carried on quite a trade with Italy,
Greece, and the countries of Asia Minor, and at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg&nbsp;176]</a></span>
Leghorn&mdash;upon the Italian coast&mdash;they had numerous
trading shops and docks for their own vessels. They
began to suffer, not only great annoyance, but also
great loss, from the depredations of the French privateers
which swarmed about the harbor mouth and
scurried into every corner of the ragged coast-line.
Their trade was hampered, their ships compelled to
remain in port, or&mdash;if they ventured out&mdash;they
were inevitably captured. The situation was unbearable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! My!&rdquo; said one of the red-faced merchants.
&ldquo;My! My! We must have a remedy for this. My!
My! We must have our own privateers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well spoken,&rdquo; cried another. &ldquo;And I know the
very man to help us out. He is living here, now, and
his name is Fortunatus Wright. Gentlemen! I tell
you he is a true sea-dog! He is the fellow to cripple
these saucy, French bushwhackers of the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear! Hear!&rdquo; cried others.</p>

<p>And thus Mr. Fortunatus Wright was sought for,
and was asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you take charge of a privateer for the British
merchants of Leghorn? Will you chase these rascally
Frenchmen? Will you cripple their operations? Will
you chastise these sea-robbers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this Mr. Fortunatus Wright, being a true seaman
with the love of the salt water tugging at his
heart strings, is said to have remarked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoop-ee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which being interpreted means:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, I&rsquo;m dee-lighted!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
As luck would have it, there was a vessel lying in
the harbor which was directly available. She was a
brigantine called the <i>Fame</i>, and, although we know
little about her tonnage and the number of stout sea-dogs
whom she could carry, it is apparent that Fortunatus
Wright considered her most admirably suited
for his venture. At any rate he soon boarded her,
swore in a crew of stalwart seamen, and saw that
plenty of gunpowder, cutlasses, boarding-pikes and
muskets were aboard.</p>

<p>It was September, 1746, and, before the close of
the month of December, the <i>Fame</i> had captured eighteen
prizes, one of which was a hulking, French privateer
with twenty guns and one hundred and fifty
men, especially fitted out to put an end to the career
of the vessel of Fortunatus Wright. They had met
off the port of Messina and had had a roaring, little
scrimmage, but&mdash;seeing that matters were going ill
with him&mdash;the French captain had cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run for the shore! Run our ship aground! We
will fix her so that this English hound cannot make
a prize of us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Voil&agrave;! Voil&agrave;!&rdquo; his men had shouted. &ldquo;Oui!
We will f-e-e-x th-e-es Eengleesh chien! Oui! Au
revoir, Monsieur Wright!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, the privateer had been run upon the
sandy beach, bows on, where her crew took to the
brush, yelling derisively at the <i>Fame</i> as she came up
within hail,&mdash;sails snug down so as to move cautiously.</p>

<p>The Frenchmen had counted without their host.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll float her, my hearties!&rdquo; cried Wright.
&ldquo;All hands ashore in the small boats. Tie hawsers
to her stern and pull her off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This they did, while the French captain, far back
in the brush, saw it and fairly boiled with disappointment
and rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zees Wright,&rdquo; he blustered. &ldquo;One cannot outweet
heem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the privateer was towed into the harbor of Leghorn,
where all the English merchants cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good! Good! Now we have a true man to fight
our battles! Huzzah for Fortunatus Wright!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The French were furious, while at the island of
Malta (where were numerous French, Spanish, Austrian
and English traders) the feeling grew intense.
Here the Austrians sided with the English and several
duels were fought by angry officers, as crafty Fortunatus
Wright continued to send in his prizes.</p>

<p>Finally the French merchants forwarded a missive
to Marseilles, in France, which ran:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can the French be further humiliated by this corsair&mdash;this
robber&mdash;Fortunatus Wright? Let our
people fit out a privateer sufficiently large to cope with
him, and let her defeat and cripple this fellow. Make
haste, for he is doing much damage!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An answer came back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before a month is gone, Monsieur Wright will no
more harass your privateers. What we have determined
to do, we shall do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Word of this was brought to Captain Fortunatus
Wright and he only smiled broadly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span>
another ship to bring into Malta, care of F. Wright,
Esq.,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And it will be labelled Collect on
Delivery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not three weeks later the French vessel came
jauntily into the harbor of Malta. The captain was a
man of considerable repute as a seaman and fighter,
and he was warmly received by the French. They
invited him to many dinners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Voil&agrave;!&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;Here is the fellow to do the
tr-e-e-k. Tenez! There will soon be one b-e-eg mince
pie we-eth Captain Wright eenside. Ha! Ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is never well to count your chickens before they
hatch or to pat a man upon the back before he has won a victory.</p>

<p>Eagerly the French captain cruised outside, continually
upon the watch for slippery Skipper Wright.
His vessel was superior to the <i>Fame</i> in numbers of
both guns and men. He was sure of victory. &ldquo;If
only the hated Englishman would appear!&rdquo; he grumbled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the excitement and expectation at Malta
became intense. Finally it was noised abroad that the
terrible privateer had been sighted about five miles off
the harbor. All factions were aroused: the Austrians
and English slapping the French and Spaniards upon
the back, and saying, &ldquo;Now there will be a chance
to sink bold Captain Wright, Messieurs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which the irritable Frenchmen would answer,
&ldquo;Ah! Yes! He will be gobbled up like Jonah by the
whale. Pouff!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The French privateer sailed out to meet the foe,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg&nbsp;180]</a></span>
and soon her white canvas had disappeared from view
around a jutting headland. The stranger ran off.
The Frenchman pursued, and soon both were lost to
the eager gaze of the population of Malta, which
crowded every headland, eager and expectant for the
bloody battle. The shore was black with people.</p>

<p>Hours passed. Another day came and with it the
news that two vessels had been sighted off the entrance
to the harbor. Hundreds rushed to the headlands and
cliffs in order to see the victor and the vanquished,
for two cruisers were approaching, the one towing
the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huzzah!&rdquo; shouted an enthusiastic Frenchman.
&ldquo;We have won! See&mdash;up go the French colors upon
the first vessel. The other&mdash;poof&mdash;eet ees a jelly.
Eet ees pounded to ze shreds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huzzah!&rdquo; shouted all of his compatriots, and
they danced about, shaking hands, embracing, and
waving their hats and their handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ce cher Wright!&rdquo; cried they. &ldquo;He ees een the
soup, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And what of the Englishmen?</p>

<p>They&mdash;of course&mdash;said nothing, but bit their
lips, looked at their Austrian friends, and hung their
heads dejectedly.</p>

<p>Here is the most beautiful part of all this story,
for Fortunatus Wright, my boys, was a joker&mdash;a
real, true end man in a minstrel show&mdash;and he was
having his fun with &ldquo;the Frenchies.&rdquo; His vessel&mdash;indeed&mdash;had
come off victorious, in spite of the fact
that she had been much more shattered than the other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span>
contestant. Therefore, Wright had put her in tow
of the captured Frenchman, which he, himself, was
steering, with the crew of his opponent down in the
hold, as prisoners of war.</p>

<p>Seeing the crowded headlands and swarming ramparts
in the harbor, he could not resist the temptation
of hoisting the flag of France. He chuckled as he saw
the effect it produced upon the crowd, then&mdash;as the
vessels rounded a fort at the entrance to the harbor&mdash;down
came the colors of France and up went the English
flag to the peak, with the French flag below.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;well, you can imagine how the Englishmen
and Austrians yelled, and how the poor
Frenchmen beat a hasty flight for their homes. Fortunatus
Wright had had a sweet revenge. He laughed
long and hard, while the Frenchmen said, &ldquo;Curse
heem! He ees a devil! A thousand curses upon the
head of thees Wright! Sapristi!&rdquo; And they did not
open any more bottles of wine for their supposedly
great captain from Marseilles.</p>

<p>As for Fortunatus Wright, he continued to harass
the French and get into trouble, as the following anecdote
well shows.</p>

<p>Not long after his famous battle, he was travelling
in Italy with introductions to many of the nobility,
and arrived&mdash;one day&mdash;before the city gates of
Lucca. Here was stationed a guard, and a sentinel
scrutinized him with great care and deliberation.</p>

<p>Fortunatus Wright grew impatient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I not go by?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My passports are
correct!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span>
&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; answered the soldier. &ldquo;I no likea
zose peestols in your belta. You must deeliver them
to me before you can go to ze ceety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The English sea-captain said nothing, but the color
rose in his cheeks. In an instant he raised one of his
pistols and pointed it at the head of the astonished
sentry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first man that endeavors to take my weapons
from me,&rdquo; he yelled, &ldquo;does so at the cost of his life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The guardsman was flabbergasted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Corporal of the Guard! Post Number Two!&rdquo; he
shouted, presenting his musket at the same instant,
and pointing it at the head of the irascible Captain
Wright.</p>

<p>Immediately a dozen soldiers came running to the
spot. They surrounded the irate English traveller.
He was ordered to &ldquo;Throw up your hands!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You air one mad Englishmana!&rdquo; said the Officer
of the Guard. &ldquo;Here. Comea weeth usa! We weel
feexa youa!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seeing that the odds were too much against him,
Captain Wright allowed himself to be taken to the
guard house, while a soldier was dispatched to the
British Ambassador in order to explain that &ldquo;they
had captured an Englishman as mad as a mad dog!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Things looked bad for the great privateersman.
But was his name not Fortunatus? And was not
good fortune always with him?</p>

<p>A nobleman to whom the bold mariner had a letter
now intervened in his favor, and secured the release
of the high-tempered man-of-the-sea. On the morning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg&nbsp;183]</a></span>
of the fourth day of his captivity, and at the early
hour of four, a soldier waked Captain Fortunatus
Wright, who was peacefully sleeping at a military
prison. A missive was handed him, and he read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Seigneur Wright</span>:&mdash;Since you have been so
daring as to attempt to enter the town of Lucca by
force, it is therefore ordered that you shall now leave
the State and never presume to enter it again, without
leave from the Republic. Post-horses, with a guard to
see you over the border, are now ready for you. We
trust that you shall have a safe journey.</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;By order of the<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Governor of Lucca</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;These Italians are the most unreasonable people
alive,&rdquo; growled Captain Wright. But he pocketed
both his pride and his pistols, entered the post-chaise
at the door, and was soon rolling forth for other parts.
In spite of this order&mdash;he continued to reside in
Italy, with the true independence of a privateersman.</p>

<p>In December, 1746, the bold seafarer made an exceptionally
good capture: a French vessel on a voyage
from Marseilles to Naples, with a rich cargo and
the servants and luggage of a real potentate,&mdash;the
Prince of Campo Florida.</p>

<p>When valorous Wright stepped aboard of her, her
captain was scraping and bowing near the rail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Seigneur!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have taken me,
that is true. But you cannot touch my cargo or my
men. See,&mdash;here is a pass from King George the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>
Second of England. It says, &lsquo;All of the cargo, passengers,
and crew of <i>La Belle Florence</i> shall be exempt
from molestation by English cruisers and privateers.&rsquo;
What say you to that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Wright looked sad, but he seized the paper
and read it with care. His smile broadened as he
perused the document.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How am I to know that this particular ship is to
go free?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;For although you told me that
the name of your vessel (<i>La Belle Florence</i>) was mentioned
in this document, I do not find that it is mentioned.
The paper merely states that &lsquo;the vessel&rsquo;
shall not be molested, and, my boy, you may have
stolen this from some other skipper. Ah! Ha! You
are my prize and shall go with me into Leghorn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You should have seen the face of the Frenchman!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I vill haf revenge!&rdquo; said he. And he had it.</p>

<p>For, when the matter was referred to the British
Minister, he turned it over to the Admiral who commanded
the English ships at this station, and this
high official made Captain Wright give up both vessel
and cargo. He did so with the same unwillingness
that he had shown when asked to leave the quaint,
little town of Lucca. Captain Wright, you see, had
that bull-dog stubbornness which is characteristic of
men of the British Isles. He believed in hanging on
to everything which he took.</p>

<p>A bit later, this trait got him into serious difficulties
and into prison.</p>

<p>A number of English merchants were trading with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg&nbsp;185]</a></span>
the people of Turkey under the name of &ldquo;The Company
of English Merchants trading to the Levant
Sea,&rdquo; and, finding it impossible to ship all of their
goods in British vessels, they often sent them in the
holds of French ships. True it was that France was
at war with England at this time, but, as these were
English cargoes, the British naturally thought that
they should be allowed to come through, unmolested,
even though the French vessels might be captured by
English privateers. But they had not reckoned with
Fortunatus Wright.</p>

<p>Two French clipper ships were scudding quietly
along off the Italian coast, one bright day in June of
1747, when a rakish vessel appeared upon the horizon
and speedily bore down upon them. They crowded
on sail, but they could not outdistance their pursuer,
who was soon near enough to fire a gun across the
bow of the foremost, and flaunt the English colors
in her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Helas!&rdquo; growled the French skipper. &ldquo;Eet ees
that devil, ze Captain Wright. Eet is all up with
me! Helas!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he came to and surrendered; but the other fellow
pounded away at the British privateer with a couple
of swivel guns and put up a smart, little skirmish
before a well-directed shot from the deck of the Englishman,
knocked a topmast crashing over the port
side. Crippled, she surrendered.</p>

<p>It did not take Captain Wright long to sail into
Leghorn harbor with his prizes. The holds were
filled with bales of rich goods, marked: &ldquo;The property
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg&nbsp;186]</a></span>
of the Company of English Merchants trading
to the Levant Sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sell the bloomin&rsquo; cargoes,&rdquo; cried Wright.
&ldquo;For the vessels were under the French flag and
we&rsquo;re at war with that nation. Besides this, one of
them put up a fight against me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus&mdash;the cargoes were sold&mdash;Captain Fortunatus
pocketed the money, and went upon his way, rejoicing.</p>

<p>But he did not rejoice very long, for the British
merchants were furious with anger, and procured&mdash;through
some means or other&mdash;an order from the
English Government to the effect that English cargoes
in French vessels were not to be touched&mdash;when captured
by British privateers. Word was sent to Captain
Wright to refund the money which he had secured
by the sale of the cargoes captured in the French ships,
and the property of &ldquo;The Company of English Merchants
trading to the Levant Sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this Captain Wright answered, &ldquo;Bah! I have
the money. I intend to keep it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Orders were sent from England to have this fellow
arrested and shipped home; so the Italian police
obligingly captured the old sea-dog, locked him up,
and kept him in jail for six months, while the attorneys
fought over the legality of the affair.</p>

<p>At length the bluff privateersman was allowed to
go free, and&mdash;he never paid back the money. &ldquo;These
fellows attacked me at law,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;but I have
not acted contrary to it. I am an Englishman. I am
acting under a commission from the King of England,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>
and, when we are at war with France, I intend to
hold and keep all the cargoes which I capture in
French vessels. As for this &lsquo;English Company trading
to the Levant Sea!&rsquo; let them learn a lesson and
pack their goods in future in English vessels. English
oak should be good enough for English cargoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;English Company trading to the Levant Sea&rdquo;
had certainly learned that Fortunatus Wright was as
stubborn as a mule, and&mdash;in the future&mdash;they employed
no French vessels to carry their bales of commerce.
<em>A wise dog only allows himself to be bitten
once.</em></p>

<p>France and England now came to a peaceable settlement
of their difficulties, but in 1755 war broke out
afresh. Fortunatus Wright chuckled, for he itched
for another brush upon the wide sweep of the ocean,
and a chance to take a prize or two. So the <i>Fame</i>
not being available, he had a small vessel constructed
at Leghorn, and called her the <i>Saint George</i>. She was
a fast sailer and was as graceful as a sea-gull. &ldquo;In
this fair ship,&rdquo; said he, as he gazed upon her admiringly,
&ldquo;I shall take many a prize and shall have, I
trust, many a sharp adventure. <i>Saint George</i>, I salute
you! May you bring me only the best of luck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Trouble was in store for the well-hated mariner
even before he turned his vessel&rsquo;s prow into the Mediterranean,
for&mdash;in spite of the fact that the Italians
were neutral&mdash;their sympathies were strongly with
France, and they looked with decided disfavor upon
the graceful hull of the <i>Saint George</i>, as she bobbed
serenely upon the surface of the bay. Knowing full
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg&nbsp;188]</a></span>
well the reputation of this famous seaman, they paid
particular attention to his little craft, and sent a number
of officials to inspect her. In a few days the intrepid
Fortunatus received the information that, as his
was a merchant vessel, he must carry a crew of only
five-and-twenty men, and an armament of four small
guns.</p>

<p>At this the old sea-dog only laughed, and exhibited
the greatest anxiety to comply with the requirements
of the law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would suggest,&rdquo; said he to one of the officials
of the town, &ldquo;that you keep guard-boats rowing
around my ship in order to be sure that I do not take
on more guns and men than the law permits, before
I set sail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The officer smiled. &ldquo;We are watching you
closely,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;For Monsieur Wright, it is said
that you are as crafty as a cat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mariner grinned, and, before going to sea,
obtained from the Governor, a certificate to the effect
that he had complied with all the requirements of the
law.</p>

<p>Armed with this, on July 28th, 1756, he put to sea,
in company with four merchant vessels laden with
valuable cargoes, and bound for the shores of England.
Carefully the <i>Saint George</i> had been watched,
so carefully, in fact, that the authorities had overlooked
the lading of the other vessels, aboard which
numerous guns, howitzers, and hand-spikes had been
smuggled, besides a number of seamen who were
well-experienced in fighting upon the ocean. It is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg&nbsp;189]</a></span>
true that Fortunatus Wright was as crafty as a cat,
or&mdash;as they say in Maine&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to git up
early if yer wanted ter lick him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not only had the officials at Leghorn watched every
move of this well-known privateersman, but they had
sent word to the French that Wright had only a feeble
force, that he was accompanying several rich prizes,
and that he could be easily beaten and captured by a
vessel of any size. So much hated was he, that it is
said the French king had promised Knighthood and
a handsome life pension to the sailor who could bring
Wright to the shores of France <em>dead or alive</em>. The
merchants of Marseilles were particularly bitter against
him, for he had captured many of their ships, and in
the market-place (where all could see it) had been
posted a placard, which ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">&ldquo;ALL SAILORS AND SEAMEN ATTENTION!</p>

<p>To the person, or persons, who will capture and bring to
France, the body of the arch-villain Captain Fortunatus Wright,
shall be given</p>

<p class="center">A SUM DOUBLE THE VALUE OF WRIGHT&rsquo;S VESSEL.</p>

<p>Frenchmen! Catch this Thief! Bring him in Dead or Alive!
Do your Duty!</p>

<p>This sum is guaranteed by the Merchants and Ship-owners of
Marseilles, and the Chamber of Commerce.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Wright had heard of this, and it sent a grim look
into his eyes. He also heard that a vessel was cruising
outside the harbor in wait for him, and thus he
was not surprised, as he saw a large boat upon his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg&nbsp;190]</a></span>
port bow, when only a few hours&rsquo; sail from the snug
harbor of Leghorn.</p>

<p>This vessel&mdash;a zebeque&mdash;had been waiting for the
well-hated privateersman for several days, as her captain
had been warned by the Italians that Wright was
about to set sail. She had three masts, each carrying
a huge, three-cornered sail, sixteen guns of considerable
size, and several swivels. Her crew numbered
two hundred and eighty men, well armed and eager
for a brush with the famous Fortunatus, whose proverbial
good fortune seemed now to have deserted
him.</p>

<p>Rounding to, Wright signalled to his merchantmen
to draw near and hurriedly transported some of the
cannon, which he had smuggled, to his own vessel.
He also added to his small crew, so that&mdash;when the
zebeque came pounding down within shooting distance&mdash;he
had increased his sailors from twenty-five
to seventy-five, and his guns, from four to
twelve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let the Frenchie come on!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
half prepared, but I&rsquo;ll give her a warmer welcome than
she ever had in all her career!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huzzah! Huzzah!&rdquo; shouted his men, who were
a motley collection of all nationalities: Italians, English,
Portuguese, Dutch, Germans, and a few Arabs.
&ldquo;Huzzah! Huzzah! Wright forever!&rdquo; The Arabs,
of course, didn&rsquo;t say this, but they tried to.</p>

<p>The French were very confident, and, as they came
within range of the guns of the little <i>Saint George</i>
they began to sing a hymn of victory, while their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>
captain already saw, in his hands, the rich reward
offered by the good citizens of Marseilles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poof!&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Monsieur Wright, he soon
take dinnaire in my cabin. Poof!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Monsieur Wright was a different fellow than
he imagined, and his men&mdash;although of all nationalities&mdash;were
so animated by his stirring and martial
spirit, that they fought better than they had ever
fought in their lives before. You all know how necessary
to success &ldquo;Spirit&rdquo; is in a foot-ball team, or
a base-ball nine. The team which has the do-or-dare
spirit, the never-give-up-until-the-last-gun-is-fired determination,
is usually the team that wins. And the
spirit of the captain is the controlling factor in
any contest. If he be no desperate fighter, his
followers will not be desperate fighters. If he is
weak-kneed in a crisis, his followers will be weak-kneed.</p>

<p>So this motley crew, under Fortunatus Wright,
cheered onward by the dauntless navigator, fought as
they had never fought before. Arab and German
strove as well as Englishman and Italian to battle
strenuously beneath the eye of the famous privateersman.
They had never been together before, but, animated
by the presence of this fearless &ldquo;cock-of-the-Mediterranean,&rdquo;
they now sailed into the Frenchman
as if the zebeque were a vessel of equal strength and
armament. Cheer after cheer welled into the air as
the two antagonists drew near each other, while the
puff of white smoke from the sides of the French
vessel was followed by the <em>chug! chug!</em> of solid shot,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg&nbsp;192]</a></span>
as it cut up the waves near the body of the staunch,
little <i>Saint George</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s three to one against us, Boys!&rdquo; shouted the
battle-scarred Captain Wright. &ldquo;Fire for the enemy&rsquo;s
rigging and bring down one of her masts, if you can.
If you fight hard we can lick her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The screech of a shell cut his words short, for a
piece of iron passed dangerously near his lips, striking
a stout Italian in the neck, and rendering him useless
for further conflict.</p>

<p>Around and around in a wide circle floated the two
sea-warriors, for the wind was light and just drove
them along at the rate of a snail&rsquo;s pace. The rag-tag-and-bob-tail
crew on the <i>Saint George</i> stood to their
guns like veterans and poured in such a hot fire that
the French captain speedily realized that his only
chance for victory was to board and overwhelm the
English by superior numbers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring the vessel up on her starboard side!&rdquo; he
commanded. &ldquo;And get out the boarding-pikes!
Now we&rsquo;ll finish Captain Wright!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The zebeque soon ranged alongside the battered
<i>Saint George</i>, threw her grappling hooks into the rigging,
and her men were in a hand-to-hand struggle
with the motley crew who battled for the veteran
Fortunatus. <em>Slash! Slash! Crack!</em> The cutlasses
cut and parried, the pistols spat, and the boarding-pikes
thrust and struck. Cheering wildly the Frenchmen
attempted to climb upon the deck of the privateer,
but the followers of old Wright fought like demons.
They parried and thrust like fiends; and such was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg&nbsp;193]</a></span>
ferocity of their struggle that the boarders were repulsed
with great slaughter.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 487px;">
<a name="boarders_repulsed" id="boarders_repulsed"></a>
<img src="images/fpas13.jpg" width="487" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;THE BOARDERS WERE REPULSED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thees Wright ees a very hornet for a fight!&rdquo;
sighed the French captain, as he ordered the grappling
hooks cast off, and floated his vessel away.</p>

<p><em>Poom! Poom!</em></p>

<p>There was still some fight left in the little <i>Saint
George</i> and her dauntless crew kept pounding iron at
the sullen zebeque, which, shattered and torn, filled
away and made for the open sea. Her captain had
been struck by a piece of shell just as the battle closed;
two lieutenants were killed, seventy men were
wounded, and eighty-eight had been killed by the accurate
shooting of the &ldquo;Never-Say-Dies&rdquo; under Captain
Fortunatus Wright: the invincible. It had been
a gallant battle, gallantly fought by both sides, and
gallantly won.</p>

<p>Bold navigator Wright followed his crippled adversary
for several miles, then&mdash;seeing another
French gun-boat threatening his convoy&mdash;he returned
to the merchant-ships which had accompanied
him; sent them back into Leghorn harbor; and followed,
next day, with the proud, but battered <i>Saint
George</i>. It had been a glorious victory.</p>

<p>No sooner had the war-scarred Captain Wright
let go his anchor chains in the harbor of Leghorn
than he realized that he had only just begun to
fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sapristi!&rdquo; said an Italian official. &ldquo;This pirate
has deceived us! This fellow was allowed but four
guns upon his ship and he had twelve. To the jail
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg&nbsp;194]</a></span>
with this dog! To the prison with this cut-throat!
Sapristi!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A boat soon rowed to the <i>Saint George</i> and an order
was delivered to Captain Wright to the effect that he
must bring his vessel into the inner harbor, and, if
he did not obey, she would be brought in by Italian
gun-boats. Wright&mdash;of course&mdash;refused. So two
big Italian warships sailed up upon either side of
the <i>Saint George</i>, ran out their guns, and cast anchor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not move for the entire Italian Government!&rdquo;
roared Captain Fortunatus. &ldquo;I will appeal
to the British consul for protection, as England is at
war with France, not with Italy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now was a pretty how-de-do. The Italians were
furious with the stubborn privateersman for refusing
to obey their orders, but, in truth, the way that
he had deceived them in smuggling the extra cannon
aboard&mdash;when under their own eyes&mdash;is what had
roused their quick, Tuscan tempers. They thought
that they had been sharp&mdash;well&mdash;here was a man
who was even sharper than they, themselves. &ldquo;Sapristi!&rdquo;
they cried. &ldquo;To the jail weeth heem!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a terrific war of words between the
British consul and the officials of that snug, little
town. Then, the problem was suddenly solved, for,
two powerful, English men-of-war dropped into the
harbor: the <i>Jersey</i> of sixty guns, and the <i>Isis</i> mounting
fifty. The authorities of Leghorn were told that
they had orders from the Admiral of the British, Mediterranean
fleet, to convoy any English merchantmen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg&nbsp;195]</a></span>
which might be there, and <em>to release the Saint George
immediately</em>. Wright threw up his cap and cheered,
but the officials of Leghorn said things which cannot
be printed. Thus the <i>Saint George</i> sailed upon her
way, unmolested, and was soon taking more prizes
upon the broad waters of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The path of the privateer is not strewn with roses.
Captain Fortunatus found that his reputation had gone
abroad and it had not been to his credit, for, when he
put in at Malta he was not allowed to buy provisions
for his ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a beastly pirate!&rdquo; said an official. &ldquo;You
cannot purchase anything here for your nefarious
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a privateer!&rdquo; answered Wright, with anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A privateer looks just the same to me as a pirate,&rdquo;
sarcastically sneered the official. And Captain Fortunatus
had to look elsewhere for provisions.</p>

<p>As he cruised along, a big, French cruiser of
thirty-eight guns chased the little <i>Saint George</i> as if
to gobble her up alive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys! We shall now have some fun!&rdquo; said Captain
Wright. &ldquo;I can sail faster than this Frenchy.
Just watch me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, when the great beast of a French vessel came
lumbering by, Wright played with her like a cat with
a mouse; sailed around her in circles; shot guns at her
rigging&mdash;just to aggravate the men from the sunny
land&mdash;and then dipped his ensign and went careening
away as if nothing had happened. No wonder that
the French hated and despised this valiant mariner!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span>
Wouldn&rsquo;t you have done so if you had been a Frenchman?</p>

<p>Thus Captain Fortunatus Wright continued upon
his privateering, his fighting, and his cruising; bearing
terror to his enemies but satisfaction to his friends.
His name was as well known among those who sailed
the Mediterranean as was that of the great Napoleon
in later years, and it was just as cordially hated by
those who opposed him. &ldquo;The Ogre from Leghorn&rdquo;
was one of his titles, while some applied to him the
choice epithet of &ldquo;The Red Demon from Italy.&rdquo; At
any rate this did not seem to worry the veteran sea-dog,
who continued to take prizes and make money
until the year 1757. Then he disappears from history,
for the body of brave, resolute, stubborn, and
valiant Captain Fortunatus Wright mysteriously and
suddenly vanished from this earth.</p>

<p>What was his end?</p>

<p>Perhaps he perished while boarding the deck of
some craft which was manned by men as gallant as
his own. Perhaps he fell while stemming the advance
of a crew of wild Frenchmen, eager for his blood and
remembering the many victories which he had won
over their countrymen. Perhaps, in the wild, wind-tossed
wastes of the Mediterranean, his vessel&mdash;unable
to cope with the elements&mdash;was hurled upon
some jagged rock and sunk in the sobbing waters of
the frothing sea. Perhaps he was captured, hurried
to some dark prison, and died in one of those many
dungeons which disgrace the cities of the Italian coast.
Perhaps he was hanged for privateering.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg&nbsp;197]</a></span>
At any rate, nothing is known of the last days of
this dauntless navigator save what can be gathered
from an old grave in St. Peter&rsquo;s churchyard, in
Liverpool.</p>

<p>Here is the tombstone of the father of Fortunatus
Wright, an inscription upon which, tells us that he
was a master-mariner of Liverpool; that he defended
his ship&mdash;on one occasion&mdash;most gallantly against
two vessels of superior force; and that he died, not
by the stroke of a boarding-pike, but safely in his own
home. To this is added the information that:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fortunatus Wright, his son, was always victorious,
and humane to the vanquished. He was a constant
terror to the enemies of his king and his country.&rdquo;
That is all.</p>

<p class="author">&mdash;<i>Chants from The Channel.</i>&mdash;1769.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was the year 1739, and the good people of
Charleston, South Carolina, were in a great state
of agitation. Little knots of merchants, sailors,
clerks, and dock-hands clustered about each other in
the narrow streets. And, above the hub-bub of many
voices, could be heard the solemn sentence, oft repeated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pirate is off the narrows! The pirate will
soon be here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then all would gaze seaward with startled faces,
and would murmur:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg&nbsp;202]</a></span>
&ldquo;The pirate&mdash;the Spanish pirate will be here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As they thus stood irresolutely, a strongly-knit
fellow came walking towards the dock-end. He was
clad in gray; his face was deeply seamed by long exposure
to the elements; and high top-boots of leather
encased his lower limbs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ho! Good citizens,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Do I understand
that a Spaniard has frightened you all?
Why, where&rsquo;s your courage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Courage?&rdquo; answered a rotund-bodied merchant.
&ldquo;Of that we have a plenty. But we have no ship with
which to combat this fellow&mdash;or fellows&mdash;for some
of my skippers tell me that there are two of them off
the coast, and that they&rsquo;ve captured twenty trading
vessels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The newcomer smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a staunch craft here,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My
name is Walker, and I hail from Bristol, England.
My ship&mdash;the <i>Duke William</i>&mdash;mounts but twenty
guns, and my crew is but of thirty-two, yet, I know
that many of you gentlemen will volunteer your services,
particularly if there is to be a nice little battle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear! Hear!&rdquo; came from all sides. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the
boy for us! You&rsquo;re the chap we&rsquo;ve been looking for!
Hear! Hear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It did not take long to increase the crew of the
<i>Duke William</i>. Several of the wealthy colonists volunteered
their services; many sailors were there who
had been fighting on the Spanish Main. They were
eager and anxious to join. So, before three days were
out, the <i>Duke William</i> spread her canvas for the open
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span>
sea, carrying one hundred men and an additional
twenty guns. Now&mdash;you see&mdash;she could put up an
excellent fight with the average pirate-ship which
cruised about the low-lying and sandy coast.</p>

<p>Out into the broad expanse of the Atlantic glided
the little barque and eagerly the mariners scanned the
horizon for some signs of the pirate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been hereabouts!&rdquo; cried one stout seaman.
&ldquo;For several of my mess-mates saw her sails down
near the channel islands. And her flag was surely
black with th&rsquo; skull an&rsquo; cross-bones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must have heard that we were coming, then,&rdquo;
growled Captain Walker, &ldquo;for there&rsquo;s nothing in
view.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an hour&rsquo;s time he thought differently, for,
&ldquo;Sail ho!&rdquo; sounded from the forward deck, and
there, far off to leeward, was the outline of a long,
blackish vessel, bearing no flag at her mizzen or stern.</p>

<p>Crowding on all canvas&mdash;for the breeze was light&mdash;the
<i>Duke William</i> bore away towards her. &ldquo;It
must be the pirate!&rdquo; said all, for, also crowding on
all sail, the vessel headed up the coast, and did her
utmost to get away.</p>

<p>On, on, went pursuer and pursued; on, on, and the
<i>Duke William</i> began to draw dangerously close to
the fleeing vessel, which now could be easily seen.
She was a brigantine, carrying about eighteen guns,
with a high stern and graceful lines. No flags waved
from her mast-heads.</p>

<p>Suddenly the scudding sea-warrior pointed her nose
in-shore, ran around the corner of a sandy island, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg&nbsp;204]</a></span>
bore away into a seemingly large lagoon upon the
other side. The <i>Duke William</i> followed, and, as she
rounded a jutting sand-spit, there before her lay a
little schooner, on the deck of which were seen several
sailors, waving and gesticulating frantically. Behind,
and on the shore, was an earth-work, from which
several cannon pointed their black muzzles. On a
flag-pole in the centre, waved a Spanish flag, and,
beneath it, a black ensign upon which was the skull-and-cross-bones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the pirate stronghold!&rdquo; cried several, at once.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in for a tight skirmish!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Captain Walker only smiled.</p>

<p>The brigantine, which he had been following, now
rounded-to, opened her port-holes, and fired a couple
of shots toward the pursuing craft. At the same
time an English flag was hoisted on the schooner, and
a fellow on her deck sang out through a speaking
trumpet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven you have come! We were only
captured two days ago! Hurrah for the English
flag!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Duke William</i> kept on after the brigantine, her
mixed crew yelling with joy, now that they were to
have an action.</p>

<p><em>Bang! Bang!</em></p>

<p>Her two forward guns spoke, and a shot went ripping
through one of the foresails of the pirate.</p>

<p>This was enough for the fighting spirit of those who
sailed the Spanish Main. For, putting about, the
brigantine scudded through a narrow channel, known
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg&nbsp;205]</a></span>
only to her skipper (for no one else could have followed
without grounding upon a sand-spit), and was
soon running away upon the opposite side of a low-lying
island, now flaunting the pirate-flag from her
halyards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; sadly remarked the gallant Captain
Walker, &ldquo;but we can capture the gun-battery. Make
ready to go ashore, if needed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Steering for the coast, the guns of the <i>Duke William</i>
opened upon the sandy barricade, and shot after shot
was soon making the dirt and gravel fly in every direction:</p>

<p><em>Poom! Poom! Cu-poom!</em></p>

<p>The cannon in the earth-work next began to speak,
and, it was apparent, from the strange noises which
some of them made, that they were full of rust.</p>

<p><em>Cu-Poom! Cu-Pow! Chuck-chuck-cu-swash!</em> they
roared, and a few balls began to whistle about the
spars of the <i>Duke William</i>.</p>

<p>There were some accurate marksmen upon the
deck of the British vessel, and, as she lay broadside
to the fortification, one well-aimed shot struck a cannon
and dismounted it; while another shattered the
flag-pole and brought down the flag with a crash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted the men from Charleston.
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll even up with these cursed pirates for all
the damage that they&rsquo;ve done us. Now, we&rsquo;ll teach
them not to ravage our coasts and catch our merchant
ships!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Cu-whow!</em> barked the rust-caked guns of the barricade.
&ldquo;<em>Go-slow! Go-back! Go-home!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg&nbsp;206]</a></span>
To this a full broadside roared, and the balls tore
the top of the earth-work to shreds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let thirty men take to the boats!&rdquo; commanded
Captain Walker. &ldquo;Steer for the beach and
rush the barricade with pistols and cutlasses. I don&rsquo;t
believe that there are more than a dozen men inside
the earth-work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huzzah!&rdquo; was the cheerful answer to this order,
and, in a few moments, several boats were racing for
the beach, each eager to be the first ashore.</p>

<p>As they approached, the antiquated guns on the
sand-spit became strangely silent, and, as the eager
raiders rushed valiantly upon the pirate fortress, no
shots were fired at them to impede their progress.
With a wild yell they leaped over the side of the barricade,
only to find it deserted; for whatever had been
the force that had fired these cannon, it had taken to
the brush as the English seamen drew near. Only a
few charges of ammunition were there, so it was
plainly evident that the pirates (whatever their
strength might have been) could only have held out
for a few more rounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted the raiders. &ldquo;The
fort is ours!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a sorry victory,&rdquo; said one of the crew,
&ldquo;for there&rsquo;s nothing here worth the having, except
the cannon, and they couldn&rsquo;t stand more than two
more shots without blowing up. I call it a pretty
hollow success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of this the men of Charleston were well
pleased. They had dispersed the pirates; taken their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg&nbsp;207]</a></span>
fort; and had re-captured a schooner which had recently
been taken only a few miles from the harbor-mouth
of that fair, southern city.</p>

<p>When they sailed into their home port they received
a tremendous ovation. The bells were rung in all the
churches; shots were fired; trumpets were blown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We could fall in with nothing that would stay for
us upon the seas,&rdquo; said Captain Walker, modestly; but,
in spite of this, he was treated like a great hero. All
the influential persons in the Colony offered to sign
a request that he might be given the command of a
king&rsquo;s ship; but this he declined. So they tendered
him an immense tract of land if he would remain in
that country and drive off the pirates when next they
became too bold and daring; but this he also declined,
and stuck to his ship. In a few weeks he sailed for
the Barbadoes, and then to England, in company with
three unarmed trading-vessels which placed themselves
under his convoy. The good people of Charleston
bade him a sad and affectionate farewell.</p>

<p>George Walker sailed forth smiling, but he was now
to have far more trouble than his little affair with the
pirates.</p>

<p>When half way to England, a terrific gale struck
the <i>Duke William</i> and her convoys, which separated
them by many miles, and made this good vessel
(which had dispersed the pirates) leak like a sieve.
The gale continued in its violence, while Captain
Walker was so ill that the ship&rsquo;s surgeon despaired of
his life. But note how grit and nerve pulled him
through!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg&nbsp;208]</a></span>
On the second day of the tempest, a sailor rushed
into his cabin, crying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain! Captain! We&rsquo;ll founder, for the water
is pouring into our bottom by the hogshead. We&rsquo;re
gone for unless we take to the boats!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Walker was not the man to leave his ship
in such a crisis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw all of the guns overboard, but two!&rdquo; he
ordered. &ldquo;We need those in order to signal for help
if a vessel comes near us. That will lighten us so that
we can still float awhile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was done, but, as the last cannon shot into the
waves, a sailor burst into his cabin with the intelligence
that the men had prepared to desert in the tenders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carry me on deck!&rdquo; roared the resolute captain.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give these cowards a piece of my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three sailors seized him and bore him aloft, where
he remonstrated with his men in the strongest language
possible. In spite of this, many clustered about
one of the boats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ship&rsquo;s a-sinking,&rdquo; cried one. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t
stand up for an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke, the welcome sound of, &ldquo;Sail ho!&rdquo;
arose, above the wash and roar of the angry water.</p>

<p>Sure enough, a ship was bearing down upon them,
but, to the dismay of all, she hastily hauled off again.</p>

<p>Captain Walker was astonished. &ldquo;She thinks us an
armed enemy,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Fire a gun, men, and cut
the mizzen-mast in two, so that it falls overboard.
That will show the stranger that we&rsquo;re a friend in distress.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg&nbsp;209]</a></span>
His orders were immediately obeyed and the mast
came ripping and tearing over the side. A gun also
roared, and the stranger, now convinced that the ship
was a friend, and not a foe, came bearing down upon
the crippled <i>Duke William</i>, to the rescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s one of our own convoy!&rdquo; shouted a seaman,
waving his hand joyfully. And such she proved
to be. Captain Walker had saved his crew by his
foresight and quickness of decision. Had he thrown
all of his cannon overboard he would have had no
gun with which to hail the stranger, and, had he not
cut away his own mast, she would have gone away,
fearful that he was an enemy. Three cheers for the
brave and thoughtful Captain Walker! He reached
England, at last, but he and his men were in a sorry
plight, for the vessel which had rescued them was
almost as unseaworthy as their own, which sank in
a great whirl of eddying foam, not half an hour after
they had left her. Thus ended the career of the good
ship which had chased all of the pirates away from the
harbor of Charleston. A sad fate, indeed, for such a
gallant craft.</p>

<p>Captain Walker was not long idle, for he soon took
charge of a brigantine trading to the Baltic Sea, in
spite of the fact that war had been declared with
France, and the privateers and gun-boats of that nation
hovered in his path, eager and anxious to secure
some English merchant vessel, as a prize.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see that these fellows mean to catch me, if they
can,&rdquo; said the keen-witted mariner. &ldquo;So I intend to
be ready for them if I do not happen to be near an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg&nbsp;210]</a></span>
English man-of-warsman when they come sailing
by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He therefore shipped a number of wooden guns,
which were painted black, so that, at a distance, they
looked exactly like the real thing. Upon his vessel
were only six cannon, so when&mdash;a short time afterwards&mdash;he
was chased by a French privateer off the
coast of Scotland&mdash;he had an excellent opportunity
to &ldquo;bluff&rdquo; the bold marauder.</p>

<p>As the Frenchman drew near, the vessel which Captain
Walker was on kept steadily upon her way, and,
through his glass, the cautious mariner saw that his
pursuer carried fully twenty guns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run out our dummy cannon!&rdquo; he ordered.</p>

<p>Out were thrust the black, wooden muzzles, twenty-five
in number, and&mdash;as the Frenchman was now
within shooting distance&mdash;the English boat was
luffed into the wind. In a second the British jack,
ensign, and man-of-war&rsquo;s pendant were hoisted, and a
gun was fired across the bow of the arrogant privateer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; shouted bold Walker. &ldquo;I am waiting
for you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the enemy did not come on. Instead of this,
she turned tail in a hurry, filled away, and made off
as fast as a freshening breeze would drive her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! Ha! Ha!&rdquo; laughed the genial, English
skipper. &ldquo;Bluffed by a lot of wooden guns. Ha!
Ha! Ha!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And all of his sailors gave a rousing cheer.</p>

<p>This was indeed good fortune, but Captain Walker
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg&nbsp;211]</a></span>
was soon to meet with some fortune which was quite
the reverse.</p>

<p>It was the year 1744 and the doughty sailor had
accepted the command of the privateer <i>Mars</i>, of
twenty-six guns and one hundred and thirty men,
which sailed from London for a cruise in the English
channel. With her was the <i>Boscawen</i>, another privateer
with about the same number of guns, but with a
crew of fully one hundred and eighty. They soon
had an adventure which was not all to the liking of
bold George Walker.</p>

<p>At midnight, late in December, the two privateers
were running near the coast of France. There
was a heavy mist and rain, also a fresh breeze,
so the steersmen could not well see what way they
were going. Suddenly the hulls of two large vessels
loomed up in the blackness, and the twinkling lights
from their port-holes shone upon the dripping sides of
the British privateers. Voices came through the mist&mdash;French
voices&mdash;so it was apparent that the ships
were not friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those fellows are showing much alarm,&rdquo; said
Captain Walker, a few moments later. &ldquo;I therefore
believe that the vessels are full of treasure. We&rsquo;ll
hang on until daylight, at any rate, and see whether
or no we cannot capture a rich cargo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next morning, at eight o&rsquo;clock, the fog suddenly
lifted, disclosing&mdash;not two treasure ships&mdash;but two
French men-of-war; one bearing seventy-four guns,
the other sixty-four.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egad!&rdquo; ejaculated the startled Walker. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg&nbsp;212]</a></span>
in a hornet&rsquo;s nest! I guess we&rsquo;d better run for
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Frenchmen, however, were both treasure-ships,
as well as men-of-war; both bound from the West
Indies, with cargoes worth about four millions sterling
($20,000,000), which they were carrying into the
harbor of Brest. They were not in good fighting
trim, as their heavy cargoes made them low in the
water, and very unwieldy. It is probable that they
would not have attacked the two Englishmen, had not
the captain of the <i>Boscawen</i> turned tail and fled, leaving
the <i>Mars</i> all alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see such a coward?&rdquo; cried Captain
Walker, with heat. &ldquo;Boys! We&rsquo;re in for it now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, they were: for the Frenchmen saw
that only one enemy was left, and immediately sent
the sixty-four gun ship&mdash;the <i>Fleuron</i>&mdash;in pursuit.</p>

<p>Walker turned his vessel about and clapped on
all sail, but the large gun-boat quickly overhauled
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; said Captain Walker, as she rapidly
approached. &ldquo;I do not mean to be so rash as to attempt
a regular engagement with so superior a force;
all I ask of you is to confide in me and my orders, to
get away&mdash;if possible&mdash;without striking our flag;
and, be assured, I shall not call upon you to fight unless
there is excellent opportunity for success. The
ship which pursues us is certainly the better sailer of
the two French men-of-war; yet, if we have good
fortune with our shots, we may bring down a topmast
or yard; or hurt her rigging so as to retard her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg&nbsp;213]</a></span>
pursuit. We may yet get entirely clear. So, my hearties,
do not lose your nerve!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These wise remarks were greeted with a &ldquo;Hip!
Hip! Hooray!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now was a lively chase. The <i>Mars</i> hoisted the
English flag, opened with her stern guns, and put on
all available canvas. But she was not a fast sailer,
and gradually but surely, the <i>Fleuron</i> crept up on one
side, and the other French man-of-war upon the other.
She, too, had entered the chase.</p>

<p>Finally the French vessels had the British privateer
directly between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The jig is up!&rdquo; cried Captain Walker, sadly.
&ldquo;Gentlemen, we do not strike to one ship only. Haul
down the colors!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down came the proud ensign, the sails were lowered,
and the gallant Walker entered a boat, in order
that he might be put aboard the <i>Fleuron</i> and give up
his sword. When he arrived on the deck he found the
French captain by no means in the politest of humors.</p>

<p>After receiving the weapon of the vanquished privateersman,
the Frenchman thundered in very good
English:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you fire against a force like mine in so
small a ship? Sirrah, you must be stark mad. I
compliment you upon your lack of judgment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Walker was nettled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he replied, with warmth, &ldquo;if you will look
at my commission you will find that I had as good a
right to fight as you, yourself, had. Furthermore, if
my force had not been so inferior to yours, I would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg&nbsp;214]</a></span>
have shown you more civil treatment on board my
own ship, after I had captured you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Frenchman winced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many of your bushwhackers have I killed?&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None at all, sir!&rdquo; replied the Englishman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, you should be well ashamed of your
scurvy fighting. For you have killed six of my brave
men and have wounded several with pieces of glass.
Pray, when, sir, did the rules of war allow glass to
be used as ammunition?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lie,&rdquo; cried Captain Walker. &ldquo;No glass was
used by my men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Frenchman curbed his anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what was it?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>Here a British seaman interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it would please your French Majesty,&rdquo; he said,
with a bow, &ldquo;I reckon I know what it was that you
took for glass. The captain of one of our stern guns,
when he found out that we must surrender, sir, took
about sixteen shillings from his pocket, saying:
&lsquo;Sooner than let these French rascals plunder me of
all I&rsquo;ve got in the world, I&rsquo;ll see what a bribe can do!&rsquo;
So he wrapped the money up in a bag, sir, crammed
it into a gun, and let fly at your deck. Faith, your
men were lucky to be struck by good, British coin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this all had a good laugh, and the unpleasantness
between the French captain and George Walker was
at an end. The privateersman was treated with the
greatest courtesy and was made as comfortable as
could be.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg&nbsp;215]</a></span>
The action took place on Friday and the ships were
headed for Brest, about three days&rsquo; sail away. At daybreak
on Sunday morning, four large boats were
sighted astern, and it did not take long to realize that
they were coming up pretty fast <em>and were flying the
English colors</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo; shouted Captain Walker. &ldquo;No French
prison for me. Hurray!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The English squadron gained steadily. The boats
grew nearer and nearer, while Walker&rsquo;s hopes soared
higher and higher. Finally, the French officer, who
was in charge of his own boat&mdash;the <i>Mars</i>&mdash;put his
helm up and ran to leeward, hoping to draw one of
the British vessels after him. He was successful, for
a seventy-gun ship made after him, chased him for
several miles, and finally re-captured the English
privateer. The other ships kept on and drew closer
and closer.</p>

<p>Seeing that an action would soon take place, the
French captain politely requested Walker and his
officers to go below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Messieurs!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There will soon be a leetle
affair in which the balls will fly. You will be better
off in the hold, where they cannot reach you so easily
as up here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; replied the English privateer-captain. &ldquo;I
go below with the greatest of pleasure, for I am now
certain of my liberty. Au revoir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not count your chickens before they hatch!&rdquo;
cried the Frenchman, after his retreating form.</p>

<p>The British vessels were the <i>Hampton Court</i> of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg&nbsp;216]</a></span>
seventy guns, and the <i>Sunderland</i> and <i>Dreadnought</i> of
sixty each; so, being three to two, they should have
had a fairly easy victory over the Frenchmen. But
the <i>Sunderland</i> lost a spar overboard, and dropped
astern; so it left but two to two: an even affair.</p>

<p>Alas for gallant Captain Walker! Although the
Englishmen came near the two French men-of-war,
they hung about without firing a shot; allowed the
Frenchmen to sail on unmolested, and thus carry their
astonishingly rich treasure into Brest, amid wild and
enthusiastic cheering of their crews, and groans of disappointment
from the English prisoners.</p>

<p>Yet these same prisoners had little cause to complain
of their treatment when they arrived at Brest;
for they were landed at once, and the captain and officers
were liberated on parole. The French also
treated them very well and invited the valorous George
Walker to many a repast, where they laughed at the
narrow shave that he had had from death,&mdash;for they
had left the <i>Fleuron</i> none too soon.</p>

<p>On the day following the landing, Captain Walker
was seated in the office of a counting-house, near the
dock-end, and was writing a letter to the captain of
the <i>Fleuron</i>, requesting him to send him his letter-of-credit,
which was in a tin box in a cabin of the French
man-of-war, when a terrible <em>Boom!</em> sounded upon his
ears.</p>

<p>A sailor came running past the open window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Fleuron</i> has blown up!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The
<i>Fleuron</i> is a total loss!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Walker dashed into the street; to the end
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg&nbsp;217]</a></span>
of the quay; and there a sad spectacle greeted his
eager gaze. Strewn about upon the surface of the
water were broken spars; pieces of sail; and the d&eacute;bris
of a once gallant man-of-war. The remnants of
the <i>Fleuron</i> were burning brightly.</p>

<p>The captain of the French ship came running by.
&ldquo;Helas!&rdquo; he wailed. &ldquo;A careless gunner has destroyed
my gallant vessel. Helas! Helas!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was too true. Four or five powder barrels had
been left in the magazine for saluting purposes, and
quite a little loose powder had been allowed to lie upon
the floor. Some careless seamen had gone down into
the hold with a decrepit, old lantern. The handle
broke, the flame set fire to the loose powder,&mdash;and
that was the end of the gallant ship <i>Fleuron</i>. She
burned to the water&rsquo;s edge and then went down to the
bottom with a dull, sizzling hiss; while the treasure
also disappeared. Later on, divers secured a part of
it, but much that was of value was never recovered.</p>

<p>Captain Walker did not long grieve over the loss of
his letter-of-credit, left on board the ill-starred <i>Fleuron</i>,
for he was exchanged, after a few weeks, and
was sent back to England with his crew. This was in
1745. He lost no time in reporting to the owners of
the <i>Mars</i>, and so well did they think of him, that in
a short while they sent him upon another privateering
venture aboard the <i>Boscawen</i>, which, as you remember,
had run away from the <i>Mars</i>, after she had fallen in
with the two French men-of-war. Now occurred his
greatest sea-fight.</p>

<p>The <i>Boscawen</i> had been built in France and had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg&nbsp;218]</a></span>
been a prize, taken at sea. She mounted twenty-eight
guns (nine-pounders), but Walker added two more,
and shipped a crew of three hundred and fourteen men.
Without waiting for the <i>Mars</i>, the stout sea-dog put
out to sea on April 19th, 1745, steering for the shores
of France where cruised the prize-laden clipper ships,
and the unwelcome men-of-warsmen. The British
privateersman cruised about for a whole month without
any luck, and, falling in with the privateer <i>Sheerness</i>,
joined with her in a little run in search of inoffensive
merchantmen. At daybreak a cry came from
the forward watch,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sails ho! Sails ho! Off the starboard quarter!
There&rsquo;re eight o&rsquo; them an&rsquo; heading no&rsquo; east.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both the privateers started in pursuit, but the <i>Sheerness</i>
was left far astern, as the <i>Boscawen</i> was a speedy
sailer. The latter drew near the eight scudding sail,
which suddenly veered about and formed a line, awaiting
an attack. The <i>Sheerness</i> was way astern. Would
Captain Walker advance?</p>

<p>It was eight against one, and there was no certainty
what was the armament of the vessels now standing
in a row, all ready for action. The faces of the officers
on the <i>Boscawen</i> showed anxiety and suspense, but
there was no shadow of fear upon the countenance of
Captain Walker, who now addressed them in the following
words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, I hope that you do not think the number
of prizes before us too many. Be assured, my
good friends, that by their being armed, they have
something on board of them that is worth defending.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg&nbsp;219]</a></span>
I take them to be merchantmen with letters of marque
(privateers), and homeward bound. Without doubt
we shall meet with some opposition, in which I know
that you will exhibit your usual courage. We must
conquer these superior numbers by superior skill. Be
cool. Be careful that you aim correctly, for, as we
shall be pressed on all sides, let every man do his best
to engage the enemy that he sees before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a word, Gentlemen, if you will put full confidence
in me for leading you on, I will pawn my life
upon the fact that I will bring you off victorious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurray! Hurray for Walker!&rdquo; came the reassuring
response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then go to your quarters, my hearties! Fight like
Britishers of old, and all will be well!&rdquo; cried the brave
mariner.</p>

<p>Like a hornet among a group of snap-dragons, the
<i>Boscawen</i> now sailed into the centre of the enemy&rsquo;s
line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not fire until I give the word!&rdquo; cried Captain
Walker, as the salt spray kicked and splashed about
the bow of the on-coming <i>Boscawen</i>. &ldquo;Then hammer
away like anvils on a sledge!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sixty men were ill on board the stout little English
privateer, but all save three crawled on deck in order
to render what assistance they could in pointing and
handling the guns.</p>

<p>Now was a glorious fight.</p>

<p><em>Bang! Crash! Z-i-i-p!</em></p>

<p>The French privateers were hammering away as the
Englishman approached and their balls cut and tore
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg&nbsp;220]</a></span>
through the rigging, damaging the mizzen topsail,
and splitting a topmast. Steering straight for the
largest vessel, Walker waited until he was within close
range and then gave the order:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire, and hull her if you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Poof! Cr-a-a-sh!</em></p>

<p>A blinding broadside rolled from the port of the
<i>Boscawen</i>, and the solid shot bit and tore the stranger
like a terrier mouthing a rat.</p>

<p>The valiant little privateer was now in the midst
of the enemy. Two were to right of her; two to the
left of her; one across her bow; and one across her
stern. Two of the eight decamped, at this juncture;
making the odds six, instead of eight, to one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Pow! Pow! Cu-boom!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vessel astern was banging away like a Banshee,
but a sudden <em>crash</em> from the stern guns so badly damaged
her that she hauled off. It was now five to one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep it up, boys!&rdquo; cried Walker, above the roar
and rattle of the fray. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing splendidly.
You all deserve statues in the temple of fame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huzzah!&rdquo; shouted his men. &ldquo;Hurray for the
<i>Boscawen</i>. Down with the Frenchmen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Cu-pow! Boom! Boom!</em>&rdquo; roared the cannon,
while the broadsides from the <i>Boscawen</i> were delivered
without either confusion or disorder. The five were
sparring gamely, but they were lightly armed, with
only a few guns to each, so the thirty nine-pounders
on board the English privateer were about an equal
match for the greater numbers of the foe.</p>

<p>Thus the fight raged for an hour, when, suddenly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg&nbsp;221]</a></span>
the ensign upon the mast of the French flagship was
seen to flutter to the deck. Ten minutes later a cry
arose from a sailor aboard the <i>Boscawen</i>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, Captain, she&rsquo;s sinking!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, the accurate fire from the British
privateer had so riddled the hull of the Frenchman,
that she fast filled with water, and sank, stern first,
her men escaping in their small boats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one less, anyway,&rdquo; mused Captain Walker.</p>

<p>The remaining four continued the fight, but the
little privateer was too much for them. Around and
around she veered, broadsiding with astonishing accuracy,
and knocking the spars about like a foot-ball
team kicking a ball. &ldquo;<em>Pow! Pow!</em>&rdquo; the guns roared,
and the men cried, &ldquo;Remember the oath of our captain!
Let&rsquo;s take &rsquo;em all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It began to look as if they would do it, too; for,
now upon the starboard quarter appeared the white
sails of a vessel, and, as she approached, a joyous cheer
arose from the deck of the <i>Boscawen</i>, for it was the
<i>Sheerness</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em! Now we&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em!&rdquo; yelled
the British sailors, and they plied their guns with renewed
activity and care.</p>

<p>Down came the flag upon one of the Frenchmen,
and&mdash;in a few moments&mdash;down came another.
Then, as the <i>Sheerness</i> rolled closer, two more ensigns
fluttered to the deck. There was but one Frenchman
left, and she made off, with the newcomer hot in pursuit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!&rdquo; The sailors on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg&nbsp;222]</a></span>
board the <i>Boscawen</i> were fairly jumping for joy.
&ldquo;Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!&rdquo; they yelled.</p>

<p>And well might they cheer, for had they not won
one of the pluckiest sea-fights of all history? The
enemy is said to have had one hundred and thirteen
killed and drowned, while the casualties of the <i>Boscawen</i>
amounted to but one killed and seven wounded.
&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; says an old chronicler of the spirited affair,
&ldquo;was due to the fact that the British privateer
had a bulwark of elm-planking, man-high, around her
deck. It was so fashioned that there was a step on
which the marines could mount and fire, and then
come down in order to load. Furthermore, this elm-wood
did not splinter; but kept out the bullets, and
closed up around the holes made by shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At any rate, it was a glorious victory, and when&mdash;a
few hours later&mdash;the <i>Sheerness</i> came back with the
other French vessel a prize, the total capture amounted
to six vessels: homeward bound traders from Martinique,
provided with letters of marque, and with
about six guns each. Their crews were undoubtedly
undisciplined and ill-used to shooting, else how could
they have done so badly with the <i>Boscawen</i>?</p>

<p>The prizes were headed for the English coast and
arrived at King&rsquo;s Road, Bristol, in a few days, where
a swarm of eager sight-seers crowded about the shattered
craft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! My!&rdquo; said many. &ldquo;This Walker is another
Drake. He is a valiant soul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so thought the British Admiralty, for they sent
him a letter (upon his reporting to them) which read:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg&nbsp;223]</a></span>
&ldquo;We cannot too highly congratulate and commend
you upon the seamanship and courage which you have
displayed in the capture of these French vessels. Your
daring and ability should always make your name one
to be revered by those Britishers who follow the sea.
May your future career upon the ocean but add to the
laurels which you have already won!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And were they not right?</p>

<p>Seldom has such a feat been accomplished, and
seldom has one vessel come off victorious against such
odds. If you love a game warrior, cheer for George
Walker, for he deserves it. If you are an admirer of
the fighting quality in a man, give three times three
for the privateersman who had the nerve to sail into
eight vessels,&mdash;and won out.</p>

<p>So much, indeed, did the British owners of the privateer
vessels think of Captain Walker, that he was
now placed in command of four ships, known as &ldquo;The
Royal Family of Privateers,&rdquo; for each was named
after some member of the English royal family. These
were the <i>Princess Amelia</i>, of twenty-four guns and
one hundred and fifty men: the <i>Prince Frederick</i> of
twenty-six guns and two hundred and sixty men: the
<i>Duke</i> of twenty guns and two hundred and sixty men;
and the <i>King George</i>, of thirty-two guns and three
hundred men. This last boat was commanded by
Walker, himself; the <i>Duke</i> by Edward Dottin, a
staunch sailor; the <i>Prince Frederick</i> by Hugh
Bromedge; and the <i>Princess Amelia</i> by Robert Denham.
The entire squadron carried nearly a thousand
men and one hundred and two guns, so, you see, that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg&nbsp;224]</a></span>
it could do quite a little damage to the enemies of
Merrie England.</p>

<p>Sailing in May, 1746, the squadron soon met with
hard luck, for the <i>Prince Frederick</i> ran upon a rock
in Bristol Channel, and had to be left behind; for she
was badly punctured below the water-line. The three
others sailed for the coast of France, and&mdash;a week
later&mdash;had a startling little adventure.</p>

<p>A heavy fog lay over the sobbing water, and the
three English sea-robbers were gliding along within
easy gun-shot of each other, when it was evident that
they were near some other vessels. Voices came out
of the mist, lights flashed (for it was near the close of
day), and the wash of water could be heard, as the
waves beat against solid oak planking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egad!&rdquo; whispered Captain Walker to one of his
lieutenants. &ldquo;Listen, my boy, and tell me whether
these voices are French, Spanish, or English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lieutenant held a speaking-trumpet to his ear.</p>

<p>The <em>swish</em>, <em>swish</em> of water came to the eager senses
of the anxious privateersman. That was all!</p>

<p>Captain Walker passed the word around among
his men to be absolutely silent, and, as he strained his
hearing, in order to catch the faintest sound from the
strangers, suddenly he heard the sentence,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pressy! Chantez une chanson. Je vais me
coucher.&rdquo; (Sing a song, Pressy. I am going to
bed.)</p>

<p>In a second the gallant Walker knew that, as once
before, he was in the midst of some French vessels.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg&nbsp;225]</a></span>
&ldquo;Caught!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;And I believe that
they&rsquo;re men-of-warsmen! Now we&rsquo;re in a pretty
pickle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His officers scowled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that they&rsquo;re men-o&rsquo;-warsmen,&rdquo; said one,
&ldquo;for, just now, the fog lifted for a second, and I could
make out&mdash;by their lights&mdash;that they were large
gun-ships.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Walker looked dejected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The deuce,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>But he soon regained his composure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put every light out on board,&rdquo; he ordered.
&ldquo;These fellows see us, for I hear them bearing over
our way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, from the swashing of water and glimmer
of lights in the fog, it could be seen that the great
lumbering men-of-war were closing in upon the privateer.
But the Frenchmen had a human eel to capture
and he was equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring up a couple of casks from below!&rdquo; cried
Captain Walker. They were soon on deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now put a lantern in one and lash them together,&rdquo;
he continued. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll alter our course and skip, while
the Frenchies will follow this light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ruse worked magnificently, and, when morning
dawned and the bright sun burned off the fog, the
French men-of-war found themselves hovering around
a couple of old casks with a lantern tied to the top;
while Captain Walker in the <i>King George</i> was scudding
along the French coast, many miles away. At
which the French captain remarked,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg&nbsp;226]</a></span>
&ldquo;Sapristi! L&rsquo;oiseau s&rsquo;est envol&eacute;.&rdquo; (Egad! The
bird has flown!)</p>

<p>Not long after this &ldquo;The Royal Family of Privateers&rdquo;
took some valuable prizes, and, having chased
a small, French merchantman into the bay of Safia, in
Morocco, Captain Walker determined to capture her
at night, by sending a party against her in the long-boats.
A second lieutenant was put in charge of this
venture, and, at dark three tenders, crowded with
armed seamen and propelled by muffled oars, started
after the prize. As they neared the merchantman a
hail came through the blackness:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Qui est la?&rdquo; (Who is there?)</p>

<p>No answer was made to this, but the boats kept
straight on.</p>

<p><em>Crash! Bang!</em></p>

<p>A gun roared in the faces of the privateers, and
shots came falling around them like hail-stones,&mdash;but
still they kept on.</p>

<p>Again <em>Crash! Crash! Crash!</em></p>

<p>The Frenchmen were plying their guns right willingly,
but the English sailors could not be stopped,
and they neared the vessel under vigorous sweeps of
the oars. The lieutenant in command was badly
wounded, and was forced to lie in the bottom of his
boat, but&mdash;in a few moments&mdash;the tenders were
alongside the merchantman, and the sailors, with a
wild yell, were clambering to her deck. There was a
fierce hand-to-hand struggle, but nothing would gainsay
the rush of the British tars. In twenty minutes
the fight was all over and the vessel was towed out of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg&nbsp;227]</a></span>
the bay, in triumph, next morning. As she was a
smart, little craft she was turned into a privateer in
place of the <i>Prince Frederick</i> (which had run
aground) and was christened the <i>Prince George</i>.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Royal Family&rdquo; continued upon its way, made
many captures, and&mdash;after eight months&mdash;put into
the harbor of Lisbon with prizes and prize-money
amounting to &pound;220,000 (about $1,100,000). So you
can see that privateering was a very lucrative trade in
those days, when successfully pursued. Not a single
man had been killed aboard the little fleet, but many
had been severely wounded. The ships were overhauled,
refitted, and, being joined by the <i>Prince
Frederick</i>, amounted to six in number, for the vessel
captured in the harbor of Safia had been converted
into a full-fledged privateer. Now was to be one of
the most gruelling sea-fights in which George Walker
ever engaged.</p>

<p>In the month of October the squadron was cruising
off of Lagos Bay, on the coast of Portugal, when a
large sail was sighted at about five in the morning.
The <i>Princess Amelia</i> was at anchor in the harbor of
Lagos, so Captain Walker sent a small sloop (a recent
capture) after her to tell her to &ldquo;Hurry up and
get under way,&rdquo; while he gave signal to the other
vessels to chase the stranger at once. All started after
the foreigner, who stood to the northward and could
be seen to be crowding on all possible canvas. There
were four ships in this merry little chase, but two of
them&mdash;the <i>Duke</i> and the <i>Prince George</i>&mdash;dropped
out, after about an hour&rsquo;s run. They either could not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg&nbsp;228]</a></span>
get up, or else their captains grew tired of the affair.</p>

<p>On, on, went the other privateers, and&mdash;at about
noon&mdash;Walker drew near the fugitive, in the <i>King
George</i>. The <i>Prince Frederick</i>, with her twenty-six
guns, was still some distance away, but Walker kept
after the stranger, although he now saw that she was
a large vessel,&mdash;much more powerful than the <i>King
George</i>, with her thirty-two guns and three hundred
men. He was rapidly nearing the big fellow, when it
grew suddenly calm, so that neither could move.</p>

<p>At this moment an ejaculation of astonishment
burst from the lips of some of the officers aboard the
saucy <i>King George</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a seventy-four!&rdquo; cried several. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in
a tight hole!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, the pursued hoisted her colors, ran
out her guns, and showed herself to be a man-of-warsman
carrying seventy-four cannon: over double
the amount of armament aboard the plucky <i>King
George</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out whether she&rsquo;s Spanish or Portuguese,&rdquo;
said Captain Walker, gazing carefully at her
drooping flag.</p>

<p>The colors hung down in the dead calm, and it was
impossible to tell whether they were Spanish or Portuguese;
for the two ensigns&mdash;at that period&mdash;were
very similar.</p>

<p>The sea-warriors drifted along, eyeing each other,
for about an hour, when the stranger ran in her lower
deck-guns and closed her port-holes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg&nbsp;229]</a></span>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a treasure ship,&rdquo; cried a sailor. &ldquo;And she
won&rsquo;t fight if she can avoid it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Walker turned to his officers and asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, shall we fight her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aye! Aye!&rdquo; came from all. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s afraid of
us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vessel, in fact, was a treasure ship which had
been recently chased by some English men-of-war and
had already landed her treasure, to the value of about
one million sterling (about $5,000,000). A slight
breeze sprang up, at about five in the afternoon, and
the big ship kept on her course; the gamey <i>King
George</i> following, while the white sails of the <i>Prince
Frederick</i> were far astern, as the breeze had not yet
struck her. So they swashed along, the Englishmen
anxious for a fight, and a chance to overhaul the supposed
treasure which the stranger was carrying. At
eight o&rsquo;clock the <i>King George</i> was struck by a favorable
puff of wind, and came quite close to the seventy-four.
It was time for battle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ship is that?&rdquo; hailed Captain Walker, in
the Portuguese tongue. He was cleared for action
and his men were all lying down at their quarters.
There was no answer to his challenge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ship is that?&rdquo; he asked again; this time in
English.</p>

<p>A voice came back,&mdash;also in English,</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what ship may you be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>King George</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Crash! B-oo-m!</em></p>

<p>A thundering broadside belched from the side of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg&nbsp;230]</a></span>
the seventy-four, dismounting two guns on the port
side of the <i>King George</i>, and bringing the main topsail
yard crashing to the deck. It was now bright moonlight,
and in its radiance the flag of the stranger was
seen to blow straight out, disclosing her nationality to
be Spanish. She was the <i>Glorioso</i>: a strong and powerful
vessel, ably officered and ably manned. She
towered above the little <i>King George</i> like a church-spire,
and her broadsides now sputtered with great
regularity.</p>

<p><em>Crash! Crash! Crash!</em></p>

<p>The sprightly little <i>King George</i> kept after the big
warship like a sword-fish chasing a whale. She drew
so close that some burning wads from the Spanish
guns set fire to her mainsail. Continually hoping that
the <i>Prince Frederick</i> would come up, the gallant
Walker hammered away at the <i>Glorioso</i> with furious
precision, and drove her so near the rocks off Cape
Vincent that the castle guns began to play upon the
two grappling warriors of the sea. The British sea-captain
fought and commanded with &ldquo;a calmness
peculiar to himself&rdquo; and his example secured order
and discipline even in the thickest of the fight, when
the mainsail was set on fire. He was magnificent in
action.</p>

<p>So the unequal struggle kept on. By half-past ten
the <i>King George</i> had been so severely damaged aloft
that she could not have escaped if she had tried. All
the braces were shot away; the foremast was quite
disabled; and the mainmast was badly splintered.
Battered, torn, and distressed she kept banging away
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg&nbsp;231]</a></span>
at the great, towering Spaniard; while the big fellow
ceased her fire somewhat, and ever now and again
let go a broadside, like the blow from the mouth of a
huge whale. It sounded like, <em>Chu-spow!</em></p>

</div>

<p class="caption">ACTION BETWEEN THE &ldquo;GLORIOSO&rdquo; AND THE &ldquo;KING GEORGE&rdquo; AND &ldquo;PRINCE FREDERICK&rdquo; UNDER GEORGE WALKER.</p>

<p>But hurrah! hurrah! The <i>Prince Frederick</i> had at
last caught the breeze, and came bouncing by, her little
pennons fluttering like so many silk stockings on a
clothes-line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you all well?&rdquo; shouted her commander, as
he neared the splintered <i>King George</i>. &ldquo;You look as
if you&rsquo;re sinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Walker came to the rail with the speaking-trumpet
in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One killed and fifteen wounded,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;Now sail after that Spanish villain and take her,
in revenge for all the damage that she has done me.
She&rsquo;s a treasure ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Captain Dottin called back, and he
kept on after the <i>Glorioso</i>, which was now rapidly
drawing away.</p>

<p>By the bright moonlight it could be seen that the
<i>Duke</i> and the <i>Prince George</i> were also approaching.
And, when they came close enough to the maimed
and battered <i>King George</i>, her captain called to them,
&ldquo;to keep on after the Spaniard, and catch the rascal.&rdquo;
They continued on their way, and, at daybreak the
three vessels could be seen, through the glass, as they
closed in upon the Spanish game-cock from three
sides. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be ours before nightfall,&rdquo; said Captain
Walker, chuckling.</p>

<p>The headmost ship, apparently the <i>Duke</i> under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg&nbsp;232]</a></span>
Captain Dottin, could now be seen to hotly engage the
<i>Glorioso</i>, which greatly displeased the captain of the
dismantled <i>King George</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dottin will fire away all of his cartridges,&rdquo; said
he, turning to a few of his officers, who clustered
around him. &ldquo;He will shoot them all off at too great
a distance, and will afterwards be obliged to load
with loose powder, by which some fatal accident is
sure to occur. He&rsquo;s a brave fellow, but a rash one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken, when a broadside rang out.
Simultaneously, with the discharge of the guns, a
pillar of smoke and flame shot high into the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens, the <i>Duke</i> has blown up!&rdquo; cried
Captain Walker. &ldquo;Dottin and his brave followers
have found a watery grave!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is merely the smoke of a broadside,&rdquo; one of the
officers interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; answered Walker, dejectedly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the last that will ever be seen of noble Dottin and his
men!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The smoke now cleared away and no ship was to be
seen upon the surface of the water. The <i>Glorioso</i>
was still-belching both smoke and flame, and near her
were three sails, indistinctly seen through a haze of
smoke and fog. Could it not have been the <i>Duke</i>,
after all? &ldquo;Vain thought,&rdquo; cried bold Walker, aloud.
&ldquo;Our bravest and best ship has gone to the bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This terrible incident had such an effect upon the
seamen of the <i>King George</i> that Captain Walker called
the officers aside into the companionway, and there
made them a speech.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg&nbsp;233]</a></span>
&ldquo;My brave men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you must keep up an
air of cheerfulness before these fellows of ours, for,
otherwise they will be backward in fighting, and will
not have the courage which we desire. Go among
them and show no sign that you are lacking in pleasantry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking there was a series of sudden
explosions, mingled with cries of alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gad zooks! What&rsquo;s happened!&rdquo; cried all, rushing
to the deck.</p>

<p>They found matters in a sorry state, for the crew
was in a panic; some clinging outside the ship; some
climbing out upon the bowsprit, all ready to jump
overboard should the vessel blow up.</p>

<p>Captain Walker was astonished. &ldquo;Why, men!&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;What means this confusion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was easily explained, for the alarm had been
caused by a seaman who stepped upon a number of
loaded muskets, which had been covered by a sail.
One was fired off accidentally, and this exploded some
spare ammunition, set the sail on fire, and completely
demoralized the crew; who still were thinking of the
sad tragedy which they had just witnessed. Order
was quickly restored, the blazing sail was torn down
and bucketed, and the terrified sailors came back to
their posts. When men have their nerves shattered, it
is easy to startle them.</p>

<p>But how about the <i>Glorioso</i>?</p>

<p>The fair-fighting Spaniard was far out of sight, by
now, still whanging away at her many enemies, and
still proudly flaunting the flag of Arragon in the faces
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg&nbsp;234]</a></span>
of the British war-dogs, who were snapping and snarling
at her like a wolf pack. What became of her was
not known for several days, when the poor, battered
<i>King George</i> staggered into a sheltering harbor, there
to meet with the <i>Duke</i> herself, which was Dottin&rsquo;s
good ship,&mdash;the one which all had thought to have
exploded and sunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo; shouted many. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s afloat after
all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eager questioning brought out the fact that it had
been the frigate <i>Dartmouth</i> which had exploded; a
vessel which had run near the fight in order to see
the fun. Some loose powder had set fire to her magazine,
and thus she had suffered the same fate as the
<i>Fleuron</i>, which, as you remember, had blown up, when
at anchor in the harbor of Brest. <em>It&rsquo;s a wise ship that
keeps away from a sea battle.</em></p>

<p>Only seventeen of the crew of this unfortunate
craft had been picked up by the boats of the <i>Prince
Frederick</i>; one of whom was an Irish lieutenant
named O&rsquo;Brien, who was hauled aboard Dottin&rsquo;s vessel,
clad only in a night shirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sirrah!&rdquo; said he, bowing politely. &ldquo;You must
excuse the unfitness of my dress to come aboard a
strange ship, but really I left my own in such a hurry
that I had no time to stay for a change.&rdquo; He had
been blown out of a port-hole!</p>

<p>An additional vessel, the <i>Russel</i>, had aided in the
capture of the powerful <i>Glorioso</i>, so it had taken four
privateers to down the proud Castilian: the <i>Duke</i>, the
<i>Prince George</i>, the <i>Prince Frederick</i>, and the <i>Russel</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg&nbsp;235]</a></span>
Certainly she had put up a magnificent battle and she
had completely crippled the stout little craft sailed by
Captain Walker, who was now filled with chagrin and
mortification, when he found that the treasure (which
he had been sure was in the hold) had been safely
landed at Ferrol, before he had sighted this valorous
man-of-warsman. It was a great blow both to him
and to his men, and, upon arriving at Lisbon he was
met by one of the owners of his own vessel, who
severely reprimanded him for fighting with such a
powerful boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Walker,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I fear that your fighting
blood is superior to your prudence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But to this, the game old sea-dog replied, with considerable
heat:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had the treasure been aboard the <i>Glorioso</i>, as I
expected, my dear sir, your compliment would have
been far different. Or had we let her escape from us
with the treasure aboard, what would you have said
then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To these sage reflections the owner did not reply.</p>

<p>The honesty and courage of this able seaman were
never questioned, and the following incident bears
good witness to the first quality. Upon one occasion
he was sailing for Lisbon in a well-armed privateer,
when a couple of East India trading ships offered him
&pound;1,000 ($5,000) if he would act as their guard and
protect them from the enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he to the captain of these vessels,
&ldquo;I shall never take a reward for what I consider it
my duty to do without one. I consider it my bounden
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg&nbsp;236]</a></span>
duty to conduct you both safely into port, for you
are both British ships, and I am engaged to fight the
enemies of our King.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he convoyed them safely into port and would
not take even the smallest present, in recompense for
his services.</p>

<p>As a fighter he had no superior. War is simply
glorified sport and those who are best trained athletically
can usually win upon the battle-field. Did not
Wellington say, &ldquo;The battle of Waterloo was won
upon the foot-ball grounds of Eton and Harrow?&rdquo;
Which was another way of saying that the boys who
had learned to stand punishment upon the athletic
field, could take it manfully and well upon the field of
battle.</p>

<p>Walker believed in athletic exercise and made his
sailors continually practice both gunnery and work
with the cutlass. They were always in training and
always prepared. That is the reason why they won.
As you know, if you want to win in athletics you have
to train hard and practice daily. If you want to win
at warfare you have to do likewise. The most athletic
nation is the nation which will win in the long fight,
providing that it has sufficient resources and money
to carry out a war, once that it has placed its men in
the field. It takes a great deal of money to fight a
war, but it takes trained men also, and those who are
the most fit will win every time.</p>

<p>The English are an athletic nation, an island nation,
and great numbers of her people have had to
follow the sea as a matter of course. Hence England
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg&nbsp;237]</a></span>
has always had a vast quantity of well-trained seamen
at her beck and call. For this reason she has been
more successful upon the ocean than many of her
neighbors. Will she continue to be?</p>

<p><em>If she continues to breed men like George Walker
there is little reason to doubt that she will always be
a winner in sea fighting.</em></p>

<p>As for this famous mariner, little is known of his
later life save that he was once imprisoned for debt,
but this was no disgrace in those times and I am sure
that he was soon liberated. He died September 20th,
1777, but where he was buried is not known, nor is
there any record of his marriage. At any rate he has
left the reputation of a brave and valiant seaman who
was beloved by his men, feared by his enemies, and
appreciated by his contemporaries.</p>

<p class="author">&mdash;<i>Song of the English Privateers.</i>&mdash;1794.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> FRENCH frigate lay in the silvery water off
Norfolk, Virginia, and, as she swung quietly
upon her anchor chains, a small sloop came
bobbing alongside. A hail arose from her stern,
where sat a man of about twenty-eight years; of
medium stature, strongly built and swarthy. He was
dressed in the gray clothing of a Virginian planter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo,&rdquo; he shouted in very good French. &ldquo;May
I come aboard?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Certainement! Certainement!</em>&rdquo; cried a French
officer, as he neared the rail. &ldquo;Welcome, Monsieur
Jones!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg&nbsp;242]</a></span>
And, as the Virginian farmer scrambled upon the
deck, he was greeted most effusively by a handsome
nobleman. It was Louis Philippe Joseph, Duke de
Chartres; known as &ldquo;the Sailor Prince of France.&rdquo;
The Virginian was John Paul Jones, of &ldquo;Whitehaven&rdquo;
upon the river Rappahannock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bring you delicacies of the season from my garden,&rdquo;
said the planter, smiling. &ldquo;Some for you, and
some for the commander&mdash;the Commodore de Kersaint.
I trust that you will accept them, with my
kindest regards. Meanwhile, I beg that you will give
me leave to inspect your vessel and obtain information
in regard to her plan, construction of the hull,
arrangement of the batteries, her spars, her rig and
other technical particulars. For, know you, Gentlemen,
that war has just commenced between Great
Britain and her Colonies and the newly-formed Marine
Department of the Government will require a
knowledge of ships and their construction. Partly
for this I have visited you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kersaint&rsquo;s face grew sober.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Jones,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have just heard the
news from Lexington and I am the senior officer upon
this coast. France is at peace with England. The
situation for me is a delicate one. I must refuse to
allow you to sketch any plans of my vessel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the young Duke de Chartres looked upon the
matter in a different light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall have all the assistance from me that
you wish,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I do not fear the displeasure
of England.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg&nbsp;243]</a></span>
So the Virginian planter was allowed to obtain the
most complete data of the new frigate, even to copies
of deck plans and sail spread, which he caused his
carpenter to make. John Paul Jones was the guest
of the Frenchman for two or three days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now you will visit my plantation,&rdquo; said he,
when the time came for him to leave. &ldquo;Is it not so?
For there I can repay some of the kindnesses which
you have shown me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That we cannot do,&rdquo; replied the French commander.
&ldquo;It would be most impolitic for us to accept
entertainment ashore from persons known to be
hostile to King George. But we thank you, exceedingly,
for your kind offer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So John Paul Jones proceeded alone to his plantation,
and the French warship sailed for Corunna,
Spain, after firing one gun as a salute to the new-born
nation.</p>

<p>The son of a Scotch gardener of Arbigland, Parish
of Kirkbean, the youthful farmer had emigrated to
America, where his brother owned the large plantation
upon which he now resided. He found his kinsman
dying of what was then called lung fever&mdash;in
our time pneumonia&mdash;and, as he willed him his Virginian
possessions, Jones was soon residing upon
&ldquo;3,000 acres of prime land, on the right bank of the
Rappahannock; 1,000 acres cleared and under plough,
or grass; with 2,000 acres of strong, first-growth
timber.&rdquo; He had a grist-mill; a mansion; overseer&rsquo;s
houses; negro quarters; stables; tobacco houses;
threshing floors; thirty negroes of all ages; twenty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg&nbsp;244]</a></span>
horses and colts; eighty neat cattle and calves; and
many sheep and swine. Thus lived the future sea-captain;
in peace, plenty, and seclusion, at the outbreak
of the American Revolution.</p>

<p>John Paul Jones had gone to sea at the early age
of twelve. As a master&rsquo;s apprentice upon the stout
brig <i>Friendship</i>, he had sailed from Scotland to the
North American Colonies, the West Indies, and back
again. He had kept to his seaman&rsquo;s life, and&mdash;so
improved in knowledge of his profession&mdash;that he
became second mate; then first mate; then Captain.
At twenty-one he had amassed a fortune of about
one thousand guineas ($5,000) in gold,&mdash;then equal,
in purchasing power, to three times this sum. Besides
this he had studied French and Spanish assiduously,
so that he could speak the first like a native.
It was to be of great help to the ambitious mariner.
And he had plenty of nerve, as the following incident
bears full witness:</p>

<p>Upon one of his many voyages, the crew was reduced,
by fever, to five or six hands. One of them
was a huge mulatto named Munro&mdash;or &ldquo;Mungo&rdquo;&mdash;Maxwell.
They became mutinous, and, as Captain
Jones was the only officer who could keep the deck,
it was found necessary to subdue the refractory seaman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you obey my orders?&rdquo; cried Jones, picking
up a belaying pin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go sit down,&rdquo; cried Maxwell. &ldquo;I no like
you. <em>Pish!</em> I could kill you with one crack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Paul Jones did not answer, but walking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg&nbsp;245]</a></span>
towards the big black, he struck him just one blow
with his pin. &ldquo;Mungo&rdquo; dropped to the deck and lay
there. He never rose again.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at port, Captain Jones surrendered
to the authorities, and asked for a trial. It was given
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Paul,&rdquo; asked the Judge, &ldquo;are you, in
conscience, satisfied that you used no more force than
was necessary to preserve discipline on your ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May it please the most Honorable Court, Sir,&rdquo;
answered the doughty seaman, &ldquo;it became imperative
to strike the mutinous sailor, Maxwell. Whenever
it becomes necessary for a commanding officer to hit
a seaman, it is also necessary to strike with a weapon.
I may say that the necessity to strike carries with it
the necessity to kill, or to completely disable the mutineer.
I had two brace of loaded pistols in my belt,
and could easily have shot him. I struck with a
belaying pin in preference, because I hoped that I
might subdue him without killing him. But the result
proved otherwise. I trust that the Honorable
Court and the jury will take due account of the fact
that, though amply provided with pistols throwing
ounce balls, necessarily fatal weapons, I used a belaying
pin, which, though dangerous, is not necessarily
a fatal weapon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge smiled and Captain Paul was acquitted.</p>

<p>The famous Lord Nelson once said: &ldquo;A naval
officer, unlike a military commander, can have no
fixed plans. He must always be ready for <em>the</em> chance.
It may come to-morrow, or next week, or next year,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg&nbsp;246]</a></span>
or never; but he must be <em>always ready</em>!&rdquo; Nunquam
non Paratus. (Never unprepared.)</p>

<p>Paul Jones kept a copy of this maxim in his head.
He was always in training; always on the <i>qui vive</i>;
always prepared. And&mdash;because he was always prepared&mdash;he
accomplished what would seem to be the
impossible.</p>

<p>Shortly placed in command of a sloop-of-war, the
<i>Alfred</i> (one of the four vessels which constituted the
American Navy), Lieutenant Jones assisted in an
expedition against Fort Nassau, New Providence
Island, in the Bahamas, which was a complete and
absolute failure. On the way home, and when passing
the end of Long Island, his boat was chased by
the twenty-gun sloop-of-war <i>Glasgow</i>. The long shot
kicked up a lot of spray around the fleet American
vessel, but it was of no use. Jones got away and
sailed into Newport Harbor, Rhode Island, with sails
full of holes and stern-posts peppered with lead. But
he was created a Captain; placed in command of the
<i>Providence</i>&mdash;sloop-of-war, fourteen guns and one
hundred and seven men&mdash;and soon harried the seas
in search of fighting and adventure. With him were
two faithful negro boys&mdash;Cato and Scipio&mdash;who
followed him through the many vicissitudes of the
Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>The seas traversed by the <i>Providence</i> were full of
English cruisers&mdash;superior in size to the saucy
American&mdash;but inferior in alertness and resources of
her commander and her crew. She captured sixteen
vessels&mdash;of which eight were sent to port and eight
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg&nbsp;247]</a></span>
were destroyed at sea. Twice she was chased by
British frigates, and, on one of these occasions, narrowly
escaped capture.</p>

<p>As the little sloop was running into one of the
many harbors of the coast, a fast-sailing frigate bore
down upon her from the starboard quarter.</p>

<p><em>Whang!</em></p>

<p>Her bow-guns spoke and said &ldquo;Heave to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Captain Jones had heard this call before, and
kept on upon his course.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But, as the breeze is
fresh I may run away. Stand ready, Boys, and let
go your tackle immediate, when I give the command!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The helm was now put hard-up and the <i>Providence</i>
crept into the wind. Closer and closer came the brig&mdash;now
her bow-guns sputtered&mdash;and a shot ricochetted
near the lean prow of the <i>Providence</i>. But
the sloop kept on.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;just as the brig drew alongside&mdash;Paul
Jones swung his rudder over, wore around in the
wind, and ran dead to leeward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch her sniffle!&rdquo; cried the gallant Captain, as
the brig <em>chug-chugged</em> on the dancing waves, and,
endeavoring to box short about, came up into the
wind. But fortune favored the American skipper.
Just then a squall struck the Englishman; she lost
steering way; and hung upon the waves like a huge
rubber ball, while her Captain said things that cannot
be printed.</p>

<p>When in this condition, Jones ran his boat within
half gun-shot, gave her a dose of iron from one of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg&nbsp;248]</a></span>
his stern-guns, and&mdash;before the frigate could get
squared away&mdash;was pounding off before the wind,
which was the sloop&rsquo;s best point of sailing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the crafty John Paul, his face
wreathed in smiles. &ldquo;If the frigate had simply followed
my man&oelig;uver of wearing around under easy
helm and trimming her sails as the wind bore, I could
not have distanced her much in the alteration of the
course, and she must have come off the wind very
nearly with me, and before I could get out of range.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not take to myself too great credit for getting
away. I did the best that I could, but there was
more luck than sense to it. A good or bad puff of
wind foils all kinds of skill one way or the other&mdash;and
this time when I saw the little squall cat&rsquo;s-pawing
to windward&mdash;I thought that I would ware ship and
see if the Britisher wouldn&rsquo;t get taken aback. The
old saying that &lsquo;Discretion is the better part of valor&rsquo;
may, I think, be changed to &lsquo;Impudence is&mdash;or
may be, sometimes&mdash;the better part of discretion.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two kinds of news greeted the slippery sailor when
he arrived in port. One was a letter from Thomas
Jefferson, enclosing his commission as Captain in the
Continental Navy, by Act of Congress. The other&mdash;an
epistle from his agents in Virginia, informing him
that, during the month of July previous, his plantation
had been utterly ravaged by an expedition of
British and Tories (Virginians who sided with England
in the war) under Lord Dunmore. His buildings
had all been burned; his wharf demolished; his livestock
killed; and every one of his able-bodied slaves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg&nbsp;249]</a></span>
of both sexes had been carried off to Jamaica to be
sold. The enemy had also destroyed his growing
crops; cut down his fruit trees; in short, nothing was
left of his once prosperous and valuable plantation
but the bare ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is part of the fortunes of war,&rdquo; said Jones.
&ldquo;I accept the extreme animosity displayed by Lord
Dunmore as a compliment to the sincerity of my attachment
to the cause of liberty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bold words, well spoken by a bold man!</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued the able sailor, &ldquo;I most sadly
deplore the fate of my poor negroes. The plantation
was to them a home, not a place of bondage. Their
existence was a species of grown-up childhood, not
slavery. Now they are torn away and carried off
to die under the pestilence and lash of Jamaica cane-fields;
and the price of their poor bodies will swell
the pockets of English slave-traders. For this cruelty
to those innocent, harmless people, I hope sometime,
somehow, to find an opportunity to exact a reckoning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again bold sentiments,&mdash;and the reckoning, too,
was forthcoming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no fortune left but my sword, and no
prospect except that of getting alongside of the enemy,&rdquo;
wrote the impoverished sea-captain to a Mr.
Hewes.</p>

<p>This prospect also was to soon have ample fulfilment.</p>

<p>Ordered to take command of the <i>Alfred</i>, Captain
Jones made a short cruise eastward, in 1776,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg&nbsp;250]</a></span>
accompanied by the staunch little <i>Providence</i>. The journey
lasted only thirty-three days, but, during that time,
seven ships of the enemy fell into the clutches of the
two American vessels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; cried Captain Jones, as he rubbed his
hands. &ldquo;This looks more propitious for our cause.
We have taken the <i>Mellish</i> and the <i>Biddeford</i>. Let
us break into them and see how much of the King&rsquo;s
treasure has been secured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And it was indeed good treasure!</p>

<p>The <i>Mellish</i> was found to contain ten thousand
complete uniforms, including cloaks, boots, socks and
woollen shirts, for the winter supply of General
Howe&rsquo;s army; seven thousand pairs of blankets; one
thousand four hundred tents; six hundred saddles and
complete cavalry equipments; one million seven hundred
thousand rounds of fixed ammunition (musket
cartridges); a large quantity of medical stores; forty
cases of surgical instruments; and forty-six soldiers
who were recruits sent out to join the various British
regiments then serving in the Colonies.</p>

<p>The larger prize&mdash;the <i>Biddeford</i>&mdash;carried one
thousand seven hundred fur overcoats for the use of
the Canadian troops; eleven thousand pairs of blankets,
intended partly for the British troops in Canada,
and partly for the Indians then in British pay along
the northern frontier; one thousand small-bore guns
of the type then known as the &ldquo;Indian-trade smooth-bore,&rdquo;
with hatchets, knives, and boxes of flint in
proportion, to arm the redskins. There were eight
light six-pounder field guns and complete harness and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg&nbsp;251]</a></span>
other equipage for the two four-gun batteries of horse-artillery.
Also some wines and table supplies for Sir
Guy Carleton and a case of fine Galway duelling
pistols for a British officer then serving in Canada.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These I will appropriate as mine own portion,&rdquo;
cried Captain Jones. &ldquo;And also a share of the wines,
for I must have something to drink the health of mine
enemy in.&rdquo; And&mdash;so saying&mdash;he chuckled gleefully.
It had been a rich haul.</p>

<p>But the Captain was not happy. His pet project
was to cruise in European waters, and he wanted to
get near the British coast with a ship&mdash;or better&mdash;a
squadron of some force.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cruises along the American coast,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will
annoy the enemy and result in capture of small ships
and consorts from time to time. But who&mdash;forsooth&mdash;will
hear of this in Europe? We will add nothing
to our prestige as a new nation if we win victories
upon this side of the ocean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All who heard him were much impressed by the
vehement earnestness of his arguments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have had so much success, Mr. Jones,&rdquo; said
they, &ldquo;that we feel you will have still greater good
fortune in future years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Jones said to himself: &ldquo;Oh, if I only could
get the chance!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It soon came, for on June the 14th, 1777, the
Continental Congress passed the following resolution:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Resolved:</i> That Captain John Paul Jones be appointed
to command the ship <i>Ranger</i>&rdquo; (a brand-new
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg&nbsp;252]</a></span>
sloop-of-war which had just been launched at Portsmouth,
N.&nbsp;H.).</p>

<p>This boat was designed to carry a battery of twenty
long six-pounders and was planned expressly for
speed. She was one hundred and sixteen feet long,
twenty-eight feet in breadth, and her bottom was
covered with copper: the first American ship to be
thus protected. Captain Jones put fourteen long nine-pounders
in her and only four six-pounders, but even
then she was top-heavy.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that it was not quite safe to
carry full sail, if clearing to windward, close-hauled
in squally weather; when running free&mdash;before the
wind&mdash;she could course through the water like a
jack-rabbit. In outward appearance she was a perfect
beauty, and, as she was rather low in the water
for her length, and her masts raked two or three
degrees more than any other ship of the day, she
was&mdash;on the whole&mdash;the sauciest craft afloat. Jones
was delighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the best crew I have ever seen,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;I believe it is the best in the world. They are nearly
all native Americans, and the proportion of able seamen
to the total is much beyond the average. I&rsquo;m
going to make one or two short runs off the coast&mdash;a
day or two at a time&mdash;to shake down the sails and
find the best trim of the ship. Then away to the
shores of England and France!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He waited impatiently for orders to proceed across
the blue Atlantic. On October the 18th, 1777, a
courier raced frantically into Portsmouth, crying,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg&nbsp;253]</a></span>
&ldquo;Burgoyne has surrendered! Burgoyne has surrendered!&rdquo;
And Jones&rsquo; impatience to be off increased
ten-fold.</p>

<p>There were no details of the American victory, for
the courier had reached the sleepy New England town
from the field of Stillwater, in about thirty hours, and
it was one hundred and forty-seven miles&mdash;as the
crow flies&mdash;or, about one hundred and seventy-five
by the shortest road. He had stopped only long
enough to saddle a fresh horse and shift his saddle,
eating his meals in the stirrups, and never thinking
of rest until he had shouted his tidings for three
full days. The patriot country was wild with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will spread the news in France in thirty days,&rdquo;
said Jones, when his dispatches were placed in his
hands, about midnight of October the thirty-first.
And, running by the whirling eddies of &ldquo;Pull-and-be-damned&rdquo;
Point, he soon had the <i>Ranger</i> clear of the
low-lying Isle of Shoals: the sea cross and choppy,
but the good ship bowling along before a fresh gale
of wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had sailed with many Captains,&rdquo; writes Elijah
Hall, second Lieutenant of the staunch, little vessel,
&ldquo;but I never had seen a ship crowded as Captain
Jones drove the <i>Ranger</i>. The wind held northeasterly
and fresh &rsquo;til we cleared Sable Island and began to
draw on to the Banks. Then it came northeast and
east-northeast with many snow squalls, and thick of
nights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Imagine the situation of the <i>Ranger</i>&rsquo;s crew, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg&nbsp;254]</a></span>
a top-heavy, cranky ship under their feet, and a
Commander who day and night insisted on every
rag she could stagger under, without laying clear
down!</p>

<p>As it was, she came close to beam-ends more than
once, and on one occasion righted only by letting-fly
her sheets cut with hatchets. During all this trying
work Captain Jones was his own navigating officer,
keeping the deck eighteen or twenty hours out of the
twenty-four; often serving extra grog to the men
with his own hands; and, by his example, silencing
all disposition to grumble. In the worst of it, the
watch and watch was lap-watched, so that the men
would be eight hours on to four off; but no one complained.
It speaks well alike for commander and crew
that not a man was punished or even severely reprimanded
during the terrific voyage.</p>

<p>But Captain Jones made good his boast. He actually
did land at Nantes&mdash;upon the coast of France&mdash;early
in the morning of December second, 1777, thirty-two
days out from Portsmouth. His crew were jubilant,
and sang a song which ran:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;So now we had him hard and fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burgoyne laid down his arms at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that is why we brave the blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To carry the news to London!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heigh-ho! Carry the News!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go! Go! Carry the News!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell old King George that he&rsquo;s undone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He&rsquo;s licked by the Yankee squirrel gun.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Go!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Go!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Carry the news to London!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg&nbsp;255]</a></span>
And Captain John made haste to proceed to Paris,
placing the dispatches in the hands of Dr. Franklin
early upon the fifth day of December,&mdash;travelling
two hundred and twenty miles in sixty hours. He
returned to his ship about the middle of the month,
to find that several of the crew were mutinous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here, Captain,&rdquo; said one&mdash;a seaman from
Portsmouth, New Hampshire&mdash;&ldquo;Me and my pals
enlisted at home after readin&rsquo; a hand-bill which said
that we wuz to get $40.00 apiece extra, for this cruise.
Now, your young Lieutenant tells us that the reg&rsquo;lations
of Congress say that we are to only get th&rsquo; reg&rsquo;lar
salary allotted by those old pals, who make our
laws. We came with you thinkin&rsquo; that we wuz ter
git this money, and, by gum, we intend to git it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Calm yourself, my good fellow,&rdquo; said Jones soothingly.
&ldquo;If the hand-bill said that you were to receive
$40.00 you shall have it. You shall get this sum even
if I have to pay it myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not deceive any man who has entered
or may enter, to serve in my command,&rdquo; remarked
John Paul Jones. &ldquo;I consider myself as being under
a personal obligation to these brave men, who have
cheerfully enlisted to serve with me, and I accept their
act as a proof of their good opinion of me, which I
value so highly, that I cannot permit it to be dampened
in the least degree, by misunderstanding, or failure
to perform engagements. I wish all my men to be
happy and contented. The conditions of the hand-bills
will be strictly complied with.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg&nbsp;256]</a></span>
Accordingly he disbursed one hundred and forty-seven
guineas (about $800.00) out of his own pocket,
in making good the terms of the hand-bill. Is it any
wonder that the gallant seaman was popular with his
followers?</p>

<p>But the <i>Ranger</i> lay at Brest&mdash;eager for action&mdash;her
light sails furled; her spars shining with new
varnish; her polished guns winking in the rays of
the sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, my Hearties!&rdquo; cried Captain Jones on
April the 10th, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll hie us out to the west coast
of Ireland and see if our new ship cannot make a good
name for herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sails were hoisted upon the staunch, little vessel.
Her bow was turned toward the ocean&mdash;and&mdash;with
the new flag of the infant republic fluttering from
her masts, the <i>Ranger</i> went forth for battle, for plunder,
and for glory. She was to get a little of each.</p>

<p>Arriving off the coast of Cumberland, and, learning
from fishermen decoyed on board, that there was a
large amount of shipping in the harbor of Whitehaven,
with no warship of superior force in the neighborhood
to protect it, the bold American skipper resolved
to make a dash into this quiet cove, with a
view of destroying the ships there in port. The British
authorities had no suspicion of his presence in the
Irish Sea.</p>

<p>As the <i>Ranger</i> drew near to Whitehaven, the wind
blew such a gale from the southwest, that it was impossible
to land a boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must hold off until the breeze slackens!&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg&nbsp;257]</a></span>
cried bold Captain Jones. &ldquo;This cannot last forever,
and our opportunity will soon be here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough&mdash;the wind died out about midnight
of April 22nd&mdash;and the <i>Ranger</i> beat up towards the
town. When about five hundred yards from the
shore, the vessel was hove to&mdash;two boats were lowered&mdash;and
twenty-nine seamen, with third Lieutenant
Wallingford, Midshipmen Arthur Green and
Charles Hill, jumped into them. With Jones in command
they hastened toward the coast.</p>

<p>The surprise was complete. Two small forts lay
at the mouth of the harbor, but, as the seamen scrambled
ashore, they were precipitately abandoned by the
garrison of &ldquo;coast-guards.&rdquo; Captain Jones, Midshipman
Green, and six men rushed shouting upon one
of these, capturing it without an effort; the other was
taken by Lieutenant Wallingford and eight sailors,&mdash;while
four were left behind as a boat-guard. A few
pistols spattered, a few muskets rang; but, when the
stout sea-dogs reached the tidal basin, where the shipping
lay, the townsfolk were thoroughly aroused.
Burning cotton was thrown on board of the ships
lying at anchor, but only one took fire. It was full
daylight, and the insignificance of Jones&rsquo; force became
evident to the townsfolk, who were rallying from all
directions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Retreat to the ships,&rdquo; shouted the Yankee Captain,
&ldquo;there is no time to lose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The landing party&mdash;small as it was&mdash;had become
separated into two groups; one commanded by Jones,
the other by Wallingford. Thinking that Wallingford&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg&nbsp;258]</a></span>
party was, for the moment, more seriously menaced
than his own, Jones attacked and dispersed&mdash;with
his dozen men&mdash;a force of about one hundred
of the local militia who were endeavoring to retake
the lower fort, or battery, whose guns had been spiked
by the Americans. The townsfolk and coast-guards
had joined and were making a vigorous assault upon
Wallingford. But shots flew thick and fast from the
muskets of the followers of the daring Paul Jones&mdash;as
they retreated to their own boats. The whole landing
party&mdash;with the exception of one man&mdash;finally
leaped safely into the boat, and were on board the
<i>Ranger</i> before the sun was an hour over the horizon.</p>

<p>Jones was delighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The actual results of this affair,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are
of little moment, as we destroyed but one ship. The
moral effect&mdash;however&mdash;is very great, as it has
taught the English that the fancied security of their
coasts is a Myth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact this little raid of the valiant John Paul
made the Government take expensive measures for
the defense of numerous ports hitherto relying for
protection upon the vigilance and supposed omnipotence
of the navy. It also doubled the rates of marine
insurance; which was the most grievous damage of
all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now to attack a castle!&rdquo; cried Jones, &ldquo;and bag
an Earl, too, if he is around!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Ranger</i> was headed for Solway Firth&mdash;not
more than three hours&rsquo; sail away&mdash;where, upon St.
Mary&rsquo;s Isle, was the castle of the Earl of Selkirk.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg&nbsp;259]</a></span>
&ldquo;If we can catch the noble owner of this keep,&rdquo;
said John Paul, &ldquo;we will hold him as hostage for the
better treatment of American prisoners in England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As luck would have it, the Earl was away at this
particular time, and, although the wild sea-dogs of
the <i>Ranger</i> carried off several pieces of silverware
from the castle, this was all that was captured. Lucky
Earl! But, had he fallen into the clutches of John
Paul, he would have been treated with the greatest
consideration, for the Captain of the <i>Ranger</i> was the
most chivalrous of conquerors.</p>

<p>The <i>Ranger</i> stood across the Irish Channel and next
day ran into some fisher boats.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Ha!&rdquo; laughed one of the sons of Ireland.
&ldquo;The <i>Drake</i>&mdash;the guard-ship at Carrickfergus&mdash;is
after you, and she&rsquo;s a twenty-gun sloop-of-war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Paul smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To lessen trouble,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll heave-to off the
mouth of Belfast Lough and wait for her to work out.
This will save her the pains of coming after me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he luffed his ship, lay to, and waited for the
<i>Drake</i> to sail on. Her white sails could be seen more
clearly as she neared the adventurous American. A
boat was sent out to reconnoitre&mdash;but&mdash;as it approached,
it was surrounded by tenders from the
<i>Ranger</i>; a midshipman and five men in her, were
made prisoners. Tide and wind were both against
the <i>Drake</i>; she came on slowly; and, at an hour
before sundown, was just within hail. The sea was
fairly smooth, the wind southerly and very light.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg&nbsp;260]</a></span>
&ldquo;What ship is that?&rdquo; sounded from the deck of
the <i>Drake</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The American Continental ship <i>Ranger</i>,&rdquo; rang
the clear reply. &ldquo;Lay on! We are waiting for
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both ships bore away before the wind and neared
each other to within striking distance. <em>Boom!</em> a
broadside roared from the side of the <i>Drake</i>, and the
fight had begun.</p>

<p><em>Crash! Crash!</em> Muskets spoke from the rigging of
the <i>Ranger</i>, where several seamen had climbed in the
endeavor to pick off the gunners on the deck of the
British warship. There were one hundred and fifty-seven
men upon the <i>Drake</i>; Paul Jones had one hundred
and twenty-six. The <i>Drake</i>&rsquo;s battery was sixteen
nine-pounders and four sixes. Thus&mdash;you see&mdash;the
advantage was clearly with the Britishers.</p>

<p>Both boats swung along under full canvas, pounding
away at each other like prize-fighters. Spars were
shattered; sails ripped; masts splintered in the hail
of iron. And&mdash;as the fight progressed&mdash;it could
be plainly seen that the marksmanship of those upon
the <i>Drake</i> was infinitely less accurate than that of the
Americans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Every shot of our men told,&rdquo; said Jones&mdash;not
long afterwards. &ldquo;They gave the <i>Drake</i> three broadsides
for two, right along, at that. The behavior of
my crew in this engagement more than justifies the
representations I have often made, of what American
sailors would do, if given a chance at the enemy in
his own waters. We have seen that they fight with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg&nbsp;261]</a></span>
courage on our own coast&mdash;but fought here, almost
in hail of the enemy&rsquo;s shore.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 478px;">

</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;BEGAN TO HULL THE &lsquo;DRAKE&rsquo; BELOW THE WATER-LINE.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the two ships were going off the wind, which
was light, they both rolled considerably, and together;
that is, when the <i>Ranger</i> went down to port, the
<i>Drake</i> came up to starboard. The gunners upon the
quarter-deck of the <i>Ranger</i> timed their guns, so that
they were fired as their muzzles went down and the
enemy&rsquo;s side arose. By this practice they began to
hull the <i>Drake</i> below the water-line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sink the English! Sink the English!&rdquo; cried the
powder-blackened fighters.</p>

<p>But Captain Jones thought differently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sink her!&rdquo; he yelled to gunner Starbuck,
above the din of battle. &ldquo;I want to take her alive,
instead of destroying her; for it will be much more
to our advantage if we carry her as a visible prize into
a French port.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Cap&rsquo;n!&rdquo; shouted his men. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
cripple her aloft!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They now fired as the muzzles rose, and, so terrific
were their broadsides, that the fore and main topsail-yards
came tumbling across the starboard quarter, in
a tangle of ropes, sails, and rigging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rake her! Rake her!&rdquo; shouted Jones to his men.</p>

<p>The <i>Ranger</i> luffed and crossed the stern of the
<i>Drake</i> with the purpose of spanking a full broadside
down her decks. The British boat was badly crippled
and had lost steering way.</p>

<p>But, before the well-aimed guns belched another
destructive volley into the shattered Englishman, a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg&nbsp;262]</a></span>
white flag went aloft, and a voice came: &ldquo;Hold your
fire. We surrender!&rdquo; The <i>Drake</i> was a prisoner-of-war.</p>

<p>Thus Paul Jones had won a notable victory, and
thus he had proved that the British were not invincible,
and could be defeated, upon the sea, by their own
cousins, as readily as upon the land.</p>

<p>When the <i>Ranger</i> lay in the harbor of Brest, a few
days later, with the <i>Drake</i> alongside, boats crowded
about in order to view the vessel which had captured
another,&mdash;larger than herself. And, as the <i>Ranger</i>
had taken three merchant ships on the way to the
coast of France, the black eyes of the natives shone
with beady lustre as they gazed upon the graceful hull
of the victorious sloop-of-war from Portsmouth, New
Hampshire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See Monsieur Jones,&rdquo; said they, as they nudged
each other. &ldquo;Voil&agrave;! Here is a man who is better
than our own sailors. Look at this American sea-devil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the chest of John Paul Jones swelled with
pride.</p>

<p>Eager and active, the gallant Commodore was most
unhappy during the next few months, for the <i>Ranger</i>
was ordered back to America&mdash;under his Lieutenant
Simpson. Twenty-seven of his crew, however, elected
to remain and fight with him, when he should get another
command,&mdash;among them a little Narragansett
Indian called Antony Jeremiah.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me like to see big gun shoot,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Me
like to walk on deck of enemy&rsquo;s big boat when you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg&nbsp;263]</a></span>
take it! Byme-by we take bigger ship than <i>Drake</i>
and kill heap more enemy! Ugh! Ugh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this John Paul laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Antony Jeremiah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you shall witness
one big fight if you stay with John Paul. You wait
and see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And what John Paul had said soon came to pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The French,&rdquo; writes the doughty warrior, &ldquo;have
little conception of an expedition such as I propose;
to harry the coast and destroy the commerce of the
enemy. Their idea is to leave all of that to privateers,
of which I have already been offered a dozen commands.
Some of the ships they fit out as privateers
are really respectable frigates in size, and I have seen
one, called the <i>Monsieur</i>, that mounts thirty-eight or
forty guns. But I do not wish to engage in privateering.
My object is not that of private gain, but to
serve the public in a way that may reflect credit on
our infant navy and give prestige to our country over
the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Noble sentiments&mdash;nobly expressed!</p>

<p>In spite of the gloomy outlook he at last secured
a vessel from the King himself, called the <i>Duras</i>,
which he re-christened &ldquo;<i>Le Bon Homme Richard</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>The
Good Richard</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the name assumed by Dr.
Benjamin Franklin when writing his famous &ldquo;Almanack,&rdquo;
except that he called him &ldquo;Poor Richard.&rdquo;
This was a well-merited compliment to the great and
good man, who was then Commissioner from the
United States to France, and a firm friend to the
ardent John Paul. The vessel had forty guns, &ldquo;and,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg&nbsp;264]</a></span>
writes the Minister of Marine, &ldquo;as you may find too
much difficulty in enlisting a sufficient number of
Americans, the King permits you to levy French volunteers,
until you obtain a full crew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Paul hastened to get her ready for a cruise.
&ldquo;I mounted twenty-eight long twelve-pounders on the
gun-deck,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;put eight of the long nines on
the quarter-deck, and discarded the six-pounders of
her old battery. This gave her a battery of forty-two
guns, throwing two hundred and fifty-eight pounds of
metal in a single broadside. She was the fair equivalent
of a thirty-six gun frigate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From February to June she was worked over;
refitted; resparred. On June 19th, 1779, the gallant
John Paul Jones swung out into the English
Channel; he, himself, in command of the <i>Good Richard</i>,
which carried a crew of three hundred and
seventy-five, not more than fifty of whom were Americans.
Four other vessels were with him: the <i>Alliance</i>,
a thirty-two gun frigate; the <i>Pallas</i>, a twenty-eight
gun frigate; the <i>Vengeance</i>, a twelve gun brig;
and the <i>Cerf</i>, a cutter.</p>

<p>On the second day out the <i>Alliance</i> fouled the <i>Richard</i>,
causing so much damage to both, that the squadron
was compelled to return to port for repairs, which&mdash;with
other transactions&mdash;consumed six weeks.
But the accident was a lucky one, for numerous American
sailors, who were in English prisons, were shortly
exchanged with English seamen in French dungeons;
and thus Paul Jones was able to man the <i>Good Richard</i>
with one hundred and fourteen native Americans,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg&nbsp;265]</a></span>
who were anxious to have a crack at those who had
captured them but a short time before.</p>

<p>Finally, with refitted ships and reorganized crews,
Paul Jones was ready to sail from the roadstead of
Isle de Groaix, in the early part of August, 1779,
bound upon his cruise around the British Islands.
There were four ships in this squadron: the <i>Good
Richard</i>; the <i>Alliance</i>, under Pierre Landais (a depraved
and dishonest Frenchman); the <i>Pallas</i>, under
Cottineau (an honest Frenchman); and the <i>Vengeance</i>,
a sloop-of-war. The prevailing winds
were light and baffling, so the squadron moved
slowly.</p>

<p>War had been declared between France and England,
and thus the English Channel was thronged with
privateers from both countries. The <i>Richard</i> and a
French privateer, in company, re-captured a large ship
belonging to Holland, but bound from Barcelona to
Dunkirk, France, which had been taken some days
before by an English vessel off Cape Ortegal and
ordered into Falmouth, England. England and Holland
were still at peace, at this time, but the English
claimed the right to intercept and send into their own
port for examination, all neutral vessels bound to
French ports, as England and France were then at
war. Commodore Jones took the English prize-crew
out of the Dutch ship, as prisoners of war, and then
ordered the ship into l&rsquo;Orient in charge of her own
crew, but under the command of one of his midshipmen,
until she could come under the protection of a
French port.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg&nbsp;266]</a></span>
&ldquo;Things are going well with us!&rdquo; cried Captain
Jones, rubbing his hands gleefully.</p>

<p>He soon felt much happier. For, on the morning
of August 23rd, when in the vicinity of Cape Clear,
the <i>Richard</i> sent three boats, and afterwards a fourth,
to take a brig that was becalmed in the northwest
quarter&mdash;just out of gun-shot. It proved to be the
<i>Fortune</i>, of Bristol, bound from Newfoundland
for her home-port with whale-oil, salt fish, and
barrel staves. Manned by a prize-crew of two
warrant officers and six men, she was sent to
Nantes.</p>

<p>All were happy. All were looking forward to a
good fight. It was to come to them.</p>

<p>The little fleet of war-dogs sailed northward, and,
on September 1st, about ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
the northwest promontory of Scotland was sighted.
At the same instant, two large ships bore in sight on
the same quarter, and another vessel appeared to windward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bear up! Bear up!&rdquo; cried Jones.</p>

<p>The <i>Richard</i> held over toward the first two ships
until he saw that it was the <i>Alliance</i> and a prize she
had taken about daylight,&mdash;a vessel bound for Jamaica,
from London.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now chase the other fellow!&rdquo; he cried, turning
the wheel with his own hands, and soon the <i>Good
Richard</i> was bounding over the waves in hard pursuit
of the second sail. Slowly but surely she was
overhauled. Heavily armed, she did not surrender
until after the exchange of several shots, which the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg&nbsp;267]</a></span>
<i>Richard</i> pumped into her, after running up close
enough to show her broadside.</p>

<p>A boat soon carried a number of seamen to take
possession of her, and she proved to be the British
privateer, the <i>Union</i>, mounting twenty-two six-pounders,
and bound northward from London to Quebec,
in Canada, laden with a cargo of naval and military
stores for the British troops and flotillas on the Lakes.
The <i>Union</i> also carried a valuable mail, including dispatches
for Sir William Howe, in New York, and
Sir Guy Carleton, in Canada. &ldquo;These were lost,&rdquo;
writes John Paul to good Doctor Franklin, at Paris,
for the <i>Alliance</i> imprudently showed American colors,
though English colors were still flying on the <i>Bon
Homme Richard</i>; &ldquo;the enemy thereby being induced
to throw his papers of importance overboard before
we could take possession of him.&rdquo; The prizes were
manned from the <i>Alliance</i> and sent (by Landais) into
the seaport of Bergen, in Norway.</p>

<p>The squadron now beat down the east coast of
Scotland, and, after capturing five or six small prizes,
rounded-to off the Firth of Forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend to attack the port of Leith!&rdquo; cried Jones,
&ldquo;as I understand that it is defended only by a small
guard-ship of twenty-two guns, and an old fortification
(old Leith Fort) garrisoned by a detachment of
Militia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wind was adverse, blowing off shore, with
frequent heavy squalls, but about noon of the 17th
of September, the <i>Richard</i> and the <i>Pallas</i> beat up
within gun-shot of Leith Fort and were lowering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg&nbsp;268]</a></span>
away their tenders in order to land, when a heavy
Northwest gale sprang up, compelling them to hoist
their boats, and put to sea. The gale lasted about
twenty-four hours, but, on the morning of the 19th,
the wind took another turn, the sea grew calm, and
Jones proposed to renew the attack upon Leith. The
Commander of the <i>Pallas</i> made strong objection to
this. &ldquo;I do not believe that we should stay here,&rdquo;
cried he. &ldquo;If we persist in the attempt to remain
on this station three days longer, we shall have a
squadron of heavy frigates, if not a ship of line, to
deal with. Convinced of this, I offer it as my judgment
that we had better work along the shore to-day
and to-morrow, as far as Spurn Head, and then, if
we do not fall in with the Baltic merchant fleet, stand
off the coast and make the best of our way to Dunkirk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Commodore Jones spent a few moments in reflection.
&ldquo;You are probably right, Cottineau,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;I only wish that another man like you were in command
of the <i>Alliance</i>. However, we cannot help
what is and must make the best of it. Go aboard your
ship and make sail to the south-southwest. Speak the
<i>Vengeance</i> as you run down, and tell Ricot&mdash;her
commander&mdash;to rendezvous off Spurn Head. I will
bring up the rear with this ship. We may fall in
with the Baltic fleet between here and Scarboro&rsquo;, which
is usually their first English port of destination at this
time of the year. Should you happen to sight the
<i>Alliance</i>, inform Captain Landais of our destination,
but do not communicate it to him as an order,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg&nbsp;269]</a></span>
because that would be likely to expose you only to
insult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two ships turned South, and the next three
days were without events of importance. At length
they neared the harbor of Scarboro&rsquo;, and, as they hovered
about twelve miles off the land, they saw some
vessels making for the shore, and protecting a fleet
of merchantmen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a heavy man-of-war&mdash;either a fifty-gun
frigate, or a fifty-four&mdash;with a large ship-of-war in
company,&rdquo; cried one of his Lieutenants, who had been
watching them through a glass. &ldquo;The Captain of
the larger one has cleverly man&oelig;uvered to protect his
merchant ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Commodore Jones seemed to be much pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last we&rsquo;ll have a little fight,&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Bear
hard for the land, and get between the larger vessel
and the shore!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Cottineau was signalled to and requested to
go after the sloop-of-war. About sundown the <i>Richard</i>
succeeded in weathering the large frigate and
man&oelig;uvered between her and the land.</p>

<p>The ships neared each other very gradually, for the
breeze was slight. They were on opposite tacks and
Commodore Jones readily made out the force and rate
of his antagonist. By the light of the dying day&mdash;for
it was about seven <small>P.&nbsp;M.</small>&mdash;he saw that she was a
new forty-four; a perfect beauty. It was the <i>Serapis</i>&mdash;Captain
Richard Pearson commanding&mdash;but six
months off the stocks and on her first cruise as a
convoy to the Baltic fleet of merchantmen: consisting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg&nbsp;270]</a></span>
of about forty vessels laden with timber and other
naval stores for the use of the British dockyards.
Jones had hoped to have an opportunity to attack this
flotilla, but his plans had been frustrated by the vigilance
and skill of the commander of the men-of-war
in convoy.</p>

<p>Even now Landais might have got among the merchantmen
in the fast-sailing <i>Alliance</i>, while Jones and
Cottineau occupied the attention of the two men-of-war;
but the French officer did not have sufficient
courage to tackle them, and kept well beyond striking
distance.</p>

<p>The Captain of the <i>Serapis</i> stood upon the deck,
intently gazing at the on-coming vessel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gad Zooks!&rdquo; he uttered. &ldquo;From the size of her
spars and her height out of water I take her to be
a French fifty of the time of the last war. It&rsquo;s too
dark for me to see whether she has any lower ports
or not.&rdquo; He raised his night glasses to his eyes, and,
in the light of the full moon which was now flooding
the sea with a silvery haze, saw that his opponent was
intent upon a fight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is probably Paul Jones,&rdquo; said he, lowering the
glasses. &ldquo;If so&mdash;there&rsquo;s tight work ahead. What
ship is that?&rdquo; he cried out in loud tones.</p>

<p>No answer came from the dark hull of the <i>Good
Richard</i>, but, as she swung nearer upon the rolling
waves, suddenly a flash, a roar, and a sheet of flame
belched from her side. The battle was on!</p>

<p>It was a struggle which has been talked of for
years. It was a battle about which the world never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg&nbsp;271]</a></span>
seems to tire of reading. It was <em>the</em> battle which has
made the name of John Paul Jones nautically immortal.</p>

<p>The two warriors of the deep were on the same
tack, headed northwest, driven by a slight wind which
veered to the westward. The sea was smooth, the
sky was clear, the full moon was rising&mdash;the conditions
for a night struggle were ideal.</p>

<p><em>Crash! Crash! Crash!</em></p>

<p>Broadside after broadside rolled and shrieked from
ship to ship, as the air was filled with flying bits of
iron.</p>

<p><em>Crash! Crash! Crash!</em></p>

<p>Travelling very slowly, for the wind was little more
than sufficient to give them steering-way in the tide,
the two antagonists drifted along for twenty minutes,
at cable length (600 to 900 feet&mdash;about the distance
of the 220 yard dash). But suddenly&mdash;<em>Boom!</em> an
explosion sounded in the gun-room of the <i>Good Richard</i>.
Two of her eighteen-pounders had blown up
back of the trunnions; many of the crew lay dead
and dying, the after part of the main gun-deck was
shattered like a reed: Senior Midshipman and Acting
Lieutenant John Mayrant&mdash;who had command of
this battery&mdash;was severely wounded in the head by
a fragment of one of the exploded shells, and was
scorched by the blast of flame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abandon your guns!&rdquo; shouted First Lieutenant
Dale, &ldquo;and report with your remaining men to the
main-deck battery!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; answered Mayrant, as he bound a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg&nbsp;272]</a></span>
white kerchief around his bleeding head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
with you just as soon as I give them one more shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This he endeavored to do, but not a gun could be
touched off. &ldquo;The old sixteen-pounders that formed
the battery of the lower gun-deck, did no service
whatever, except firing eight shots in all,&rdquo; writes John
Paul Jones. &ldquo;Two out of three of them burst at the
first fire, killing almost all the men who were stationed
to manage them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gunnery of the <i>Good Richard</i> was excellent.
Though her battery was one-third lighter than that
of the <i>Serapis</i>; though her gun-crews were composed&mdash;to
a great extent&mdash;of French volunteers, who had
never been at sea before&mdash;in quickness and rapidity
of fire, the shells from the American fell just as accurately
as did those from the Britisher; pointed and
gauged by regular, trained English men-of-war seamen.
The roar of belching cannon was deafening.
The superior weight and energy of the British shot
began to tell decisively against the sputtering twelve-pounders
of the <i>Richard</i>, in spite of the fact that they
were being served with quickness and precision. As
the two battling sea-monsters drifted slowly along, a
pall of sulphurous smoke hung over their black hulls,
like a sheet of escaping steam. They were drawing
nearer and nearer to each other.</p>

<p>It was now about a quarter to eight. Wounded
and dying littered the decks of both Britisher and
American, but the fight was to the death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luff! Luff!&rdquo; cried Captain Pearson, as the <i>Richard</i>
began to forge near him. &ldquo;Luff! Luff! and let
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg&nbsp;273]</a></span>
fly with all guns at the water-line. Sink the Yankee
Pirate!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Paul Jones was intent upon grappling with
his adversary. Quickly jerking the tiller to one side,
he shoved the <i>Richard</i> into the wind and endeavored
to run her&mdash;bows on&mdash;into the side of his opponent.
The <i>Serapis</i> paid off, her stern swung to, and, before
she could gather way, the <i>Richard</i>&rsquo;s jib-boom shot
over her larboard quarter and into the mizzen rigging.</p>

<p>Jones was delighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw out the grappling hooks!&rdquo; cried he, in
shrill tones. &ldquo;Hold tight to the Britisher and be
prepared to board!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an instant, many clawing irons spun out into
the mizzen stays of the <i>Serapis</i>; but, though they
caught, the lines holding them soon parted. The
<i>Serapis</i> fell off and the <i>Richard</i> lurched ahead.
Neither had been able to bring her broadsides to bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t beat her by broadsiding,&rdquo; cried Jones.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve <em>got</em> to board!&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Crash! Crash! Crash!</em></p>

<p>Again the cannon made the splinters fly. Again
the two game-cocks spat at each other like angry cats,
but, the fire from the <i>Richard</i> was far weaker than
before.</p>

<p>Commodore Jones walked hastily to the gun-deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; said he to Lieutenant Dale, &ldquo;this fellow&rsquo;s
metal is too heavy for us at this business. He is hammering
us all to pieces. We must close with him!
We must get hold of him! Be prepared at any moment
to abandon this place and bring what men you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg&nbsp;274]</a></span>
have left on the spar-deck&mdash;and give them the small
arms for boarding when you come up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Dale saluted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you in a jiffy,
Commodore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Jones walked hastily to the main deck&mdash;the
Lieutenant ran to the store-room and dealt out cutlasses,
pistols and pikes, to the eager men. The deck
was red with blood.</p>

<p>The worst carnage of all was at &ldquo;number two&rdquo; gun
of the forward, starboard division. From the first
broadside until the quarter-deck was abandoned, nineteen
different men were on this gun, and, at this time,
only one of the original crew remained. It was the
little Indian, Antony Jeremiah; or, as his mates called
him, &ldquo;Red Cherry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me join you,&rdquo; he cried, as he saw Mayrant&rsquo;s
boarding party. Seizing a cutlass and dirk, he stood
beside the cluster of men, eager and keen to have a
chance at the enemy. A soul of fire was that of the
little savage&mdash;and now he had a splendid opportunity
to indulge in the natural blood-thirst of his race,
for an Indian loves a good fight, particularly when
he is upon the winning side.</p>

<p>The vessels swung on slowly&mdash;the fire from the
<i>Serapis</i> still strong and accurate; the sputtering volleys
from the <i>Richard</i> growing weaker and weaker.
Only three of the nine-pounders on the starboard
quarter-deck were serviceable; the entire gun-deck
battery was silent and abandoned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have him,&rdquo; cheerfully cried Captain Pearson
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg&nbsp;275]</a></span>
to one of his aides. &ldquo;But, hello&rdquo;&mdash;he continued,
&ldquo;what sail is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke the <i>Alliance</i> came bounding across the
waves, headed for the two combatants, and looking
as if she were to speedily close the struggle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fight is at an end,&rdquo; said Jones, jubilantly.</p>

<p>Imagine his astonishment, chagrin, and mortification!
Instead of pounding the English vessel, the
French ally discharged a broadside full into the stern
of the <i>Richard</i>, ran off to the northward, close hauled,
and soon was beyond gun-shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coward!&rdquo; shouted John Paul, shaking his fist at
the retreating ally. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get even with you for this
if it takes me twenty years!&rdquo;</p>

<p>No wonder he was angered, for, with his main battery
completely silenced, his ship beginning to sink,
nearly half his crew disabled, his wheel shot away,
and his consort firing into him, there remained but
one chance of victory for John Paul Jones: to foul
the enemy and board her.</p>

<p>Luckily a spare tiller had been fitted to the rudder
stem of the <i>Richard</i> below the main tiller&mdash;before
leaving port&mdash;because of the fear that the wheel
would be disabled. The foresight of the Commodore
had effected this; and now&mdash;by means of this extra
steering-gear&mdash;the battered warrior-ship was enabled
to make one, last, desperate lunge for victory. It
was touch and go with John Paul Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could distinctly hear his voice amid the crashing
of musketry,&rdquo; says a seaman. &ldquo;He was cheering on
the French marines in their own tongue, uttering such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg&nbsp;276]</a></span>
imprecations upon the enemy as I have never before
or since heard in French, or any other language. He
exhorted them to take good aim, pointed out the object
of their fire, and frequently took their loaded
muskets from their hands in order to shoot them himself.
In fact, towards the very last, he had about him
a group of half a dozen marines who did nothing but
load their firelocks and hand them to the Commodore;
who fired them from his own shoulder, standing on
the quarter-deck rail by the main topmast backstay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luck now came to the disabled <i>Richard</i>. A fortunate
puff of wind struck and filled her sails, shooting
her alongside of the growling <i>Serapis</i>, and to windward.
The canvas of the Britisher flapped uselessly
against her spars. She was blanketed and lost steering-way.
In a moment the jib-boom of the English
vessel ran over the poop-deck of the American ship.
It was seized, grappled by a turn of small hawsers,
and made fast to the mizzen-mast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s ours!&rdquo; cried John Paul Jones. &ldquo;Seize that
anchor and splice it down hard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke, the fluke of the starboard anchor of
the <i>Serapis</i> hooked in the mizzen chains. It was
lashed fast, and the <i>Richard</i> had been saved.</p>

<p><em>Rattle! Rattle! Crash!</em> sounded the muskets of
the French marines. The English tried to cut their
anchor chains and get free, but all who attempted to
sever these hawsers were struck dead by the accurate
balls from the marksmen on the poop-deck and round-house
of the <i>Richard</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I demand your surrender!&rdquo; shouted Pearson.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;THEY SWARMED INTO THE FORECASTLE AMIDST FIERCE CHEERS.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg&nbsp;277]</a></span>
&ldquo;Surrender?&rdquo; cried John Paul Jones. &ldquo;Why, I
am just beginning to fight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he turned to John Mayrant, who stood ready
to rush across the hammock-nettings into the waist
of the enemy&rsquo;s ship. Twenty-seven sailors were
nearby, each with a cutlass and two ship&rsquo;s pistols.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Board &rsquo;em!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>Over the rail went the seamen&mdash;monkey-wise&mdash;over
the rail, John Mayrant leading with a dirk in
his teeth, like a Bermuda pirate. They swarmed into
the forecastle amidst fierce cheers, the rattle of musketry,
and the hiss of flames. Just at the moment
that John Mayrant&rsquo;s feet struck the enemy&rsquo;s deck, a
sailor thrust a boarding-pike through the fleshy part
of his right thigh. <em>Crack!</em> a pistol spat at him, and
he fell prostrate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember Portsea jail! Remember Portsea
jail!&rdquo; cried the dauntless raider, rushing down into
the forecastle with his wild, yelping sailors. Pearson
stood there; crest-fallen&mdash;abashed.</p>

<p>Seizing the ensign-halyards of the <i>Serapis</i>, as the
raging torrent of seamen rolled towards him, the
brave English sea-captain hauled the flag of his ship
to the deck.</p>

<p>The <i>Richard</i> had won!</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has struck; stop firing! Come on board and
take possession!&rdquo; yelled Mayrant, running to the rail.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Dale heard him, and, swinging himself
on the side of the <i>Serapis</i>, made his way to the quarter-deck,
where Captain Pearson was standing. &ldquo;I
have the honor, sir, to be the first Lieutenant of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg&nbsp;278]</a></span>
vessel alongside,&rdquo; said he saluting. &ldquo;It is the American
Continental ship <i>Bon Homme Richard</i>, under
command of Commodore Paul Jones. What vessel is
this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s late man-of-war the
<i>Serapis</i>, sir,&rdquo; was the sad response, &ldquo;and I am Captain
Richard Pearson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, sir,&rdquo; said the American officer, &ldquo;in
the haste of the moment I forgot to inform you that
my name is Richard Dale and I must request you to
pass on board the vessel alongside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pearson nodded dejectedly.</p>

<p>As he did so, the first Lieutenant of the <i>Serapis</i>
came up from below, and, looking at Captain Pearson, asked,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has the enemy struck, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir! <em>I</em> have struck!&rdquo; was the sad reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, I will go below and order our men to cease
firing,&rdquo; continued the English Lieutenant.</p>

<p>But Lieutenant Dale interrupted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will attend to that;
and, as for yourself, please accompany Captain Pearson
on board the ship alongside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With reluctant steps the two officers clambered
aboard the battered <i>Good Richard</i>, where Commodore
Jones received them with much courtesy.</p>

<p>Bowing low, Captain Pearson offered him his
sword. His first Lieutenant did likewise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Pearson,&rdquo; said the victorious John Paul,
&ldquo;you have fought heroically. You have worn this
weapon to your own credit and to the honor of your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg&nbsp;279]</a></span>
service. I hope that your sovereign will suitably
reward you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The British commander was the image of chagrin
and despair. He bowed again, and then walked slowly
into the cabin, followed by his crest-fallen Lieutenant.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight. The full moon above&mdash;in
a cloudless sky&mdash;made it almost as light as day.
Seven feet of water were in the hold of the <i>Richard</i>;
she had sunk so much that many shot-holes were
below the water-line and could not be plugged.
Nearly sixty of her crew lay dead upon her decks;
more than a hundred and twenty were desperately
wounded. Every twelve-pounder of the starboard
broadside was either dismounted, or disabled. The
starboard side, which had been opposite the <i>Serapis</i>&rsquo;s
eighteen-pounders, was driven so far in, that, but for
a few frames and stanchions which remained, the
whole gun-deck would have fallen through. She was
afire, and the flames licked upward with an eager
hiss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take the wounded aboard the <i>Serapis</i>!&rdquo; commanded
Captain Jones. &ldquo;We must desert our good
ship!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an hour&rsquo;s time all were upon the deck of the
vanquished Britisher. No one was left on the <i>Richard</i>
but the dead. The torn and tattered flag was still
flying from the gaff, and, as the battered sea-warrior
gradually settled in the long swell, the unconquered
ensign fluttered defiantly in the slight breeze. At
length the <i>Bon Homme Richard</i> plunged downward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg&nbsp;280]</a></span>
by the head; her taffrail rose momentarily on high,
and, with a hoarse roar of eddying bubbles and sucking
air, the conqueror disappeared from view. To
her immortal dead was bequeathed the flag which
they had so desperately defended.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>So ended the great battle. Thus Paul Jones had
made his name immortal. And by it he was to be
known for all time.</p>

<p>This was not the end of his career, by any means.
He never again fought for the infant Republic of the
United States. But he became an Admiral in the
Russian Navy: battled valorously for the great Empress
Catherine against the Turks, and died in Paris,
July 18th, 1792.</p>

<p>Buried at the French capital, his body was disinterred
in the year 1905, and brought to the United
States, to be entombed with military honors, at Annapolis,
Maryland.</p>

<p>Paul Jones loved brave men. The braver they were
the more he loved them. When he went ashore and
happened to meet his old sailors&mdash;every one of whom
he knew and called by his first name&mdash;they seldom
failed to strip his pockets of the last shilling. He
was generous to a fault and faithful to his friends.
His time, his purse, his influence were always at the
call of those who had served under him. A typical
sea-dog: a brave fighter,&mdash;</p>

<p>Then, why not give three times three for John Paul
Jones?</p>

<p>Are you ready?</p>

<p class="author">&mdash;<i>Ballads of Rhode Island.</i>&mdash;1782.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> TRADING vessel, laden with wheat, from Cardigan
in Wales, was lying to in the English
Channel. Nearby rolled a long-bodied American
Privateer, while a boat neared the trader, in the
stern of which sat a staunch, weather-beaten officer in
a faded pea-jacket. It was the year 1813 and war was
on between England and the United States.</p>

<p>When the blustering captain entered the cabin to
survey his prize, he spied a small box with a hole in the
top, on which was inscribed the words, &ldquo;Missionary
Box.&rdquo; He drew back, astonished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray, my bold seaman,&rdquo; said he, turning to the
Welsh captain, &ldquo;what is this?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg&nbsp;286]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied the honest, old sailor, heaving a sigh,
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis all over now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked the American privateersman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the truth is,&rdquo; said the Welshman, &ldquo;that I
and my poor fellows have been accustomed, every Monday
morning, to drop a penny each into that box for the
purpose of sending out missionaries to preach the
Gospel to the heathen; but it&rsquo;s all over now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The American seemed to be much abashed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that is very good of you.&rdquo;
And, pausing a few moments, he looked abstractedly
into the air, humming a tune beneath his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said he, at length, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not hurt a hair
of your head, nor touch your vessel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he turned on his heel, took to his boat,
and left the Welshman to pursue its even course. And&mdash;as
the privateer filled away to starboard&mdash;a voice
came from the deck of the helpless merchantman,</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless Captain Silas Talbot and his crew!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But we do not know what the owners of the privateer
said to the humane skipper about this little
affair when he returned to New York. They might
have uttered hard words about a Welshman who scored
upon him by means of a pious fraud. At any rate
Silas Talbot had done a good deed.</p>

<p>This valorous privateer was born at Dighton, Massachusetts,
on the Sakonet River about the year 1752;
beginning his career at sea as a cabin-boy. At twenty-four
he was a captain in the United States army and
fought in the Revolutionary war, for a time, on land.
But&mdash;by reason of his nautical training&mdash;he was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg&nbsp;287]</a></span>
placed in command of a fireship at New York, and was
soon promoted to be Major&mdash;but still with duties
upon the water and not the shore. While here, a
soldier came to him, one day, with his eyes alight in
excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Major,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a chance for a splendid
little enterprise. Just off the coast of Rhode Island,
near Newport, lies a British vessel, moored to a kedge.
She mounts fifteen guns and around her is stretched a
stout netting to keep off a party of boarders. But we
can cut it and get through, I&rsquo;ll warrant. And the game
is worth the candle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Young Talbot was delighted at the thought of a
little expedition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you how we&rsquo;ll cut through,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fix a small anchor at the bowsprit of our sloop.
Then, we&rsquo;ll ram her into the netting at night, and&mdash;if
our vessel can punch hard enough&mdash;we&rsquo;ll have forty
Americans upon the deck before you can say &lsquo;Jack
Robinson.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soldier laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Major Talbot,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are a true fighting
man. I&rsquo;ll have a crew for you within twenty-four
hours and we&rsquo;ll take the good sloop <i>Jasamine</i>, lying off
of Hell Gate. Ahoy for the capture of the Englishman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In two days&rsquo; time, all was ready for the expedition.
The sloop <i>Jasamine</i> slowly drifted into the harbor of
New York, an anchor spliced to her bowsprit, a crew
of sturdy adventurers aboard; and, filling away in a
stout sou&rsquo;wester, rolled down the coast in the direction
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg&nbsp;288]</a></span>
of Rhode Island. Reaching the vicinity of Newport,
she lay to behind a sheltering peninsula, waiting for the
night to come, so that she could drop down upon the
Englishman under the cloak of darkness.</p>

<p>Blackness settled upon the still and waveless water.
With muffled oars the sloop now glided towards the
dark hull of the British gun-boat; her men armed to
the teeth, with fuses alight, and ready to touch off the
cannon at the slightest sign of discovery. All was still
upon the towering deck of the war-vessel and the little
lights twinkled at her bow.</p>

<p>But what was that?</p>

<p>Suddenly a voice came through the darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No answer came but the dip of the oars in unison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who goes there? Answer, or I fire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again the slow beat of the oars and nothing more.</p>

<p><em>Crash!</em></p>

<p>A musket spoke from the jutting bow in front of
the sloop and a bullet struck in the foremast of the
staunch attacker, with a resounding z-i-n-n-g!</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re discovered,&rdquo; whispered Talbot. &ldquo;Pull for
your lives, men, and punch her like a battering-ram.
When we&rsquo;ve cut through the netting, let every fellow
dash upon her decks, and fight for every inch you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking, the bow of the sloop struck
the roping stretched around the man-o&rsquo;-warsman, and
a ripping and tearing was plainly heard above the crash
of small arms, the shouts of men, and the rumble of
hawsers. Two cannon spoke from the side of the
Englishman, and, as their roar echoed across the still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg&nbsp;289]</a></span>
ocean, the guns of the <i>Jasamine</i> belched forth their
answer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 436px;">
<a name="talbot_himself" id="talbot_himself"></a>
<img src="images/fpas18.jpg" width="436" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;TALBOT, HIMSELF, AT THE HEAD OF HIS ENTIRE CREW, CAME
LEAPING ACROSS THE SIDE.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The anchor attached to the bowsprit had done what
was desired. It tore a great hole in the stout netting,
ripped open a breach sufficiently wide for entrance to
the deck, and, as the cannon grumbled and spat at the
sloop,&mdash;the bowsprit was black with jack-tars scrambling
for an opportunity to board the Britisher.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, men,&rdquo; shouted Major Talbot, above the din.
&ldquo;Swing our craft sideways! Let go the port guns,
and then let every mother&rsquo;s son rush the foe! And
your cry must be, &lsquo;Death and no quarter!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he ceased, the good <i>Jasamine</i> was forced sideways
into the man-o&rsquo;-warsman, and, propelled by the
current, drifted against her with tremendous force,
crushing the remaining nets as she did so. A few of
the Americans were already on the deck in a terrific
struggle with the half-sleepy English seamen, but&mdash;in
a moment&mdash;Talbot, himself, at the head of his entire
crew, came leaping across the side.</p>

<p>Now was a scene of carnage. The cutlasses of both
Yankee tar and British, were doing awful execution,
and pistols were cracking like hail upon the roof.
Back, back, went the English before the vigorous assault
of the stormers, and, as the deck was now piled
with the dead and dying, the commander of the man-o&rsquo;-warsman
cried out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I surrender! Cease, you Yankee sea-dogs. You&rsquo;re
too smart for me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he held up a handkerchief tied to his
cutlass, and the battle ceased.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg&nbsp;290]</a></span>
The story of the fight of Silas Talbot&rsquo;s was now on
every lip, and all praised the daring and courage of
this valorous Major, who was as bold as a lion, and
as courageous as any seaman who sailed upon the sea.</p>

<p>Promotion came rapidly to the soldier-sailor. In
1779 he became a colonel and was placed in command
of the <i>Argo</i>, a sloop of about one hundred tons, armed
with twelve six-pounders, and carrying but sixty men.
&rsquo;Tis said that she looked like a &ldquo;clumsy Albany
trader,&rdquo; with one great, rakish mast, an immense mainsail,
and a lean boom. Her tiller was very lengthy, she
had high bulwarks and a wide stern&mdash;but, in spite of
her raw appearance, she could sail fast and could show
a clean pair of heels to most vessels of twice her size.</p>

<p>Shortly after taking charge of this privateer, word
was brought that Captain Hazard of the privateer
<i>King George</i> was off the coast of Rhode Island.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want,&rdquo; cried Captain Talbot, slapping
his knee. &ldquo;This fellow Hazard is an American.
He was born in Rhode Island, and, instead of joining
in our righteous cause against the Mother Country, he
has elected to fight against us. For the base purpose
of plundering his old neighbors and friends, he has
fitted out the <i>King George</i> and has already done great
damage on the coast. Let me but catch the old fox and
I&rsquo;ll give him a taste of American lead. I&rsquo;ll put a stop
to the depredations of this renegade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>King George</i> had fourteen guns and eighty men,
but this did not worry staunch and nervy Silas Talbot.
He started in pursuit of her, as soon as he learned of
her whereabouts, and, before many days, sighted a sail
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg&nbsp;291]</a></span>
just off the New York coast, which was hoped to be
the vessel of the renegade.</p>

<p>Mile after mile was passed. Hour by hour the <i>Argo</i>
ploughed after the silvery sails, until, late in the afternoon,
the stranger hovered near a shallow harbor on
the coast, and seemed to await the on-coming privateer
with full confidence.</p>

<p>The <i>Argo</i> boomed along under a spanking sou&rsquo;wester
and, sailing near the stranger, to the keen eyes
of Talbot came the welcome sight of <i>King George</i>
painted upon the stern of the rakish privateer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All hands man the guns,&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sink
th&rsquo; rascally Hazard with all his crew, unless he strikes.
She&rsquo;s got more men and guns, but what care we for
that. Take hold, my Hearties, and we&rsquo;ll soon make her
know her master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>King George</i> seemed to welcome the coming
fight; she luffed; lay to; and her men could be seen
standing ready at the polished cannon. Now was one
of the strangest battles of American sea history.</p>

<p>The <i>King George</i> cruised along under a full
spread of canvas, jibbed, came about upon the port
quarter of the stranger, and ran up to within shooting
distance, when a broadside was poured into the deck
of the rolling <i>Argo</i>. She replied with her own fourteen
guns, and, before they could be reloaded, the <i>King
George</i> struck her alongside; the American seaman
swarmed across the rail; and&mdash;if we are to believe a
historian of the period&mdash;&ldquo;drove the crew of <i>King
George</i> from their quarters, taking possession of her,
without a man on either side being killed.&rdquo; Hats off
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg&nbsp;292]</a></span>
to the doughty Silas Talbot for this brave adventure!
Did you ever hear of such a fight with no man ever
being slaughtered?</p>

<p>Again rang the fame of Silas Talbot, but he was not
to rest long upon laurels won. The British privateer
<i>Dragon</i>&mdash;of three hundred tons and eighty men&mdash;was
hovering near Providence, Rhode Island, hungry
and eager for unprotected merchantmen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to strike her,&rdquo; said Captain Talbot.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day in June. As the <i>Dragon</i>
drowsed along listlessly a dozen miles off the shore, her
topsails barely filling in the gentle southerly breeze, the
watch suddenly stirred, and sang out in no gentle
tones,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sail ho, off the starboard! Looks like Captain
Talbot of the <i>Argo</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain came bounding from his cabin, glass in
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure enough,&rdquo; said he, scanning the white sails
upon the horizon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Talbot and we&rsquo;re in for a
tight affair. All hands prepare for action!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was noise and confusion upon the deck of the
privateer as the guns were sponged, charges were
rammed home, and all prepared for battle. Meanwhile,
the stranger came nearer, and rounding to within
striking distance, crashed a broadside into the slumbering
<i>Dragon</i>, who had not yet shown her fangs.</p>

<p><em>Crackle! Crackle! Boom!</em></p>

<p>The small arms from the Britisher began to spit at
the advancing privateer, and seven of her fourteen
guns rang out a welcome to the sailors of Rhode
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg&nbsp;293]</a></span>
Island. The solid shot ploughed through the rigging,
cutting ropes and spars with knife-like precision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Round her to on the port quarter!&rdquo; shouted Captain
Talbot, &ldquo;and get near enough for boarding!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, as the <i>Argo</i> swung near her antagonist, the
<i>Dragon</i> dropped away&mdash;keeping just at pistol-shot
distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run her down!&rdquo; yelled the stout Rhode Islander,
as he saw this man&oelig;uvre of his wily foe. Then he
uttered an exclamation of disgust, for, as he spoke, a
bullet struck his speaking trumpet; knocking it to the
deck, and piercing it with a jagged hole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind!&rdquo; cried he, little disconcerted at the
mishap. &ldquo;Give it to her, boys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he again uttered an exclamation, for a bounding
cannon ball&mdash;ricochetting from the deck&mdash;took
off the end of his coat-tail.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle with you for that,&rdquo; yelled the old sea-dog,
leaping to a cannon, and, pointing it himself, he
touched the fuse to the vent. A puff of smoke, a roar,
and a ball ploughed into the mainmast of the rocking
<i>Dragon</i>.</p>

<p>Talbot smiled with good humor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play for that, my brave fellows,&rdquo; he called out,
above the din of battle. &ldquo;Once get the mainmast
overside, and we can board her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a cheer, his sailors redoubled their efforts to
sink the <i>Dragon</i>, and solid shot fairly rained into her
hull, as the two antagonists bobbed around the rolling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg&nbsp;294]</a></span>
ocean in this death grapple. Thus they sparred and
clashed for four and a half hours, when, with a great
splitting of sails and wreck of rigging, the mainmast
of the <i>Dragon</i> trembled, wavered, and fell to leeward
with a sickening thud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s ours!&rdquo; yelled Captain Talbot, through his
dented speaking trumpet.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the <i>Dragon</i> had had enough. Her
wings had been clipped, and, in a moment more, a
white flag flew from her rigging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Argo</i> is sinking! The <i>Argo</i> is sinking!&rdquo;
came a cry, at this moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inspect the sides of our sloop,&rdquo; cried Talbot.</p>

<p>This was done, immediately, and it was found that
there were numerous shot-holes between wind and
water, which were speedily plugged up. Then, bearing
down upon the crippled <i>Dragon</i>, she was boarded;
a prize-crew was put aboard; and the <i>Argo</i> steered for
home, her men singing,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Talk about your gay, old cocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yankee, Doodle, Dandy,<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>Silas Talbot, in fact, had done extremely well, but,
not content with his laurels already won, he soon put
out again upon the <i>Argo</i>, in company with another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg&nbsp;295]</a></span>
privateer from Providence, Rhode Island, called the
<i>Saratoga</i>; which sailed under a Captain Munro. They
were not off the coast more than two days when they
came across the <i>Dublin</i>; a smart, English privateer-cutter
of fourteen guns, coming out of Sandy Hook.
Instead of running away, she ploughed onward, and
cleared for action.</p>

<p>The <i>Argo</i> and the <i>Saratoga</i> ran in upon the windward
quarter and banged away with audacity. The
fight lasted for an hour. Then&mdash;as the <i>Argo</i> tacked
in closer in order to grapple and board&mdash;the <i>Saratoga</i>
was headed for the privateer. But&mdash;instead of coming
in&mdash;she began to run off in the wind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard a-weather! Hard up there with the helm!&rdquo;
cried Captain Munro.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is hard up!&rdquo; cried the steersman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lie, you blackguard!&rdquo; cried Munro. &ldquo;She
goes away lasking! Hard a-weather I say again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is hard a-weather, I say again, captain,&rdquo; cried
the fellow at the tiller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Talbot thinks that I am running away
when I want to join him,&rdquo; cried Munro. &ldquo;What the
deuce is the matter anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I can tell you,&rdquo; cried a young Lieutenant.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got an iron tiller in place of the wooden one,
and she&rsquo;s loose in the rudder head, so your boat won&rsquo;t
steer correctly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egad, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Munro, as he examined
the top of the tiller. &ldquo;Now, jam her over and we&rsquo;ll
catch this <i>Dublin</i> of old Ireland, or else I&rsquo;m no sailor.
We&rsquo;ll give her a broadside, too, when we come up.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg&nbsp;296]</a></span>
The <i>Argo</i>, meanwhile, was hammering the Englishman
in good fashion, and, as the <i>Saratoga</i> pumped a
broadside into her&mdash;raking her from bow to stern&mdash;the
<i>Dublin</i> struck her colors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two to one, is too much odds,&rdquo; cried the English
captain, as a boat neared the side of his vessel. &ldquo;I
could have licked either of you, alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, at this, both of the American privateersmen
chuckled.</p>

<p>Old &ldquo;Si&rdquo; Talbot was soon in another fight. Three
days later he chased another sail, and coming up with
her, found his antagonist to be the <i>Betsy</i>: an English
privateer of twelve guns and fifty-eight men, commanded
by an honest Scotchman.</p>

<p>The <i>Argo</i> ranged up alongside and Talbot hailed
the stranger. After a bit of talk he hoisted the Stars
and Stripes, crying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must haul down those British colors, my
friend!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which the Scot replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding I find you an enemy, as I suspected,
yet, sir, I believe that I shall let them hang a
little longer, with your permission. So fire away,
Flanagan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; yelled Talbot. &ldquo;Flanagan will
be O&rsquo;Toole and O&rsquo;Grady before the morning&rsquo;s over.
For I&rsquo;ll beat you like an Irish constable from Cork.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it turned out. Before an hour was past, the
<i>Betsy</i> had struck, the captain was killed, and all of
his officers were wounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Si&rdquo;&mdash;you see&mdash;had had good luck. So
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg&nbsp;297]</a></span>
well, indeed, had he fought, that in 1780 he was put
in command of a good-sized vessel, the <i>General Washington</i>.
In her he cruised about Sandy Hook in search
of spoil.</p>

<p>One hazy day in August, the watch sang out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Several sail astern, Sir! Looks like a whole
squadron!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Talbot seized the glass and gazed intently at the
specks of white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egad! It <em>is</em> a squadron,&rdquo; said he, at length.
&ldquo;And they&rsquo;re after me. Crowd on every stitch of
canvas and we&rsquo;ll run for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So all sail was hoisted, and the <i>General Washington</i>
stood out to sea.</p>

<p>But the sails of the pursuers grew strangely clear.
They came closer, ever closer, and Talbot paced the
deck impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gad Zooks!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I wish that I could fly like
a bird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could not fly, and, in two hours&rsquo; time the red flag
on the foremast of a British brig was clear to the eyes
of the crew of the privateer. When&mdash;an hour later&mdash;a
solid shot spun across his bow, &ldquo;Old Si&rdquo; Talbot hove
to, and ran up the white flag. He was surrounded by
six vessels of the English and he felt, for once, that
discretion was the better part of valor.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>&ldquo;Old Si&rdquo; was now thrown into a prison ship off
Long Island and then was taken to England aboard
the <i>Yarmouth</i>. Imprisoned at Dartmoor, he made
four desperate attempts to escape. All failed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg&nbsp;298]</a></span>
In the summer of 1781 he was liberated; found his
way home to Rhode Island; and died &ldquo;with his boots
on&rdquo; in New York, June 30th, 1813. The old sea-dogs
of his native state still cherish the memory of
&ldquo;Capting Si;&rdquo; singing a little song, which runs:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was about eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening. The
moon was bright, and as the privateer <i>Pomona</i>
swung along in the fresh breeze, her Captain,
Isaiah Robinson of New York, laid his hand softly
upon the shoulder of his first officer, Joshua Barney,
saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;A ship off the lee-quarter, Barney, she&rsquo;s an Englishman,
or else my name&rsquo;s not Robinson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barney raised his glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A British brig, and after us, too. She&rsquo;s a fast
sailer and is overhauling us. But we&rsquo;ll let her have
a broadside from our twelve guns and I believe that
we can stop her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Pomona</i> carried thirty-five men. Laden with
tobacco for Bordeaux, France, she was headed for
that sunny land,&mdash;but all ready for a fight, if one
should come to her. And for this she carried twelve
guns, as her first officer had said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg&nbsp;302]</a></span>
The British boat came nearer and nearer. Finally
she was close enough for a voice to be heard from her
deck, and she ran up her colors. A cry came from
the black body,</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ship is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no reply, but the Stars and Stripes were
soon floating from the mainmast of the American.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haul down those colors!&rdquo; came from the Britisher.</p>

<p>There was no answer, but the <i>Pomona</i> swung
around so that her port guns could bear, and a clashing
broadside plunged into the pursuer. Down came
her fore-topsail, the rigging cut and torn in many
places, and, as the American again showed her heels,
the British captain cried out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;All sail aloft and catch the saucy and insolent
privateer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then commenced one of the most interesting running
actions of American naval history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cursed American has no stern-gun ports,&rdquo;
said the British sea-captain. &ldquo;So keep the ship abaft,
and on th&rsquo; port quarter, where we can let loose our
bow-guns and get little in return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was done, but&mdash;if we are to believe an old
chronicler of the period&mdash;&ldquo;The British crew had
been thrown into such confusion by the <i>Pomona</i>&rsquo;s
first broadside that <em>they were able to fire only one or
two shots every half hour</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Gad,&rdquo; cried Joshua Barney to Captain Robinson,
about this time, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s cut a hole in our stern,
shove a cannon through it, and whale the British
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg&nbsp;303]</a></span>
landlubber as he nears us for another shot with her
bow-chasers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain grinned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good idea, Barney, a good idea,&rdquo; he chuckled.
&ldquo;Now we can teach her to keep clear of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So a three-pounder soon poked her nose through
the stern, and, when the proud Britisher again came
up for one of her leisurely discharges, she received a
dose of grape which made her captain haul off precipitously.
Nor did he venture near again for another
shot at the saucy fugitive.</p>

<p>When daylight came, sixteen guns were counted
upon the British brig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By George!&rdquo; shouted Barney. &ldquo;See those officers
in the rigging. She&rsquo;s a gun-ship&mdash;a regular
ship-of-war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Captain Robinson laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an old game,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re tryin&rsquo;
to fool us into the belief that she&rsquo;s a real gun-boat,
so&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ll surrender immediately. But see&mdash;she&rsquo;s
drawin&rsquo; near again&mdash;and seems as if she&rsquo;s about to
board us from the looks of her crew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barney gazed intently at the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Load the three-pounder
with grape-shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here&rsquo;s a crow-bar as&rsquo;ll top it off nice,&rdquo; put
in a sailor.</p>

<p>Captain Robinson laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, spike her in, too. She&rsquo;ll plunk a hole clear
through th&rsquo; rascal,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll touch her off
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg&nbsp;304]</a></span>
The British gun-boat drew nearer and nearer. Just
as she was within striking distance&mdash;about ten yards&mdash;the
three-pounder was touched off with a deaf&rsquo;ning
roar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So accurate was the aim,&rdquo; says an old historian,
&ldquo;that the British were completely baffled in their
attempt; their foresails and all their weather foreshrouds
being cut away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give her a broadside!&rdquo; called out Captain Robinson,
as the brig sheered off in order to support its
foremast, which tottered with its own weight; the
rigging which supported it, being half cut away. And,
as he spoke&mdash;the crew let drive a shower of balls
and grape-shot. It was the last volley.</p>

<p>The <i>Pomona</i> kept upon her course, while the white
sails of the attacker grew fainter and fainter upon
the horizon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw her name as she ranged in close to us,&rdquo;
said Joshua Barney, slapping Captain Robinson on the
back. &ldquo;And it was the <i>Rosebud</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon that <i>Rosebud</i> has no thorns left,&rdquo;
chuckled Captain Robinson, and he was still chuckling
when the little <i>Pomona</i> safely sailed into the harbor
of Bordeaux in France. The voyage had been
a success.</p>

<p>Here a store of guns, powder and shot was purchased,
and, having shipped a cargo of brandy, and
raised the crew to seventy men, the staunch, little vessel
set sail for America.</p>

<p>Not three days from the coast of France the cry
of &ldquo;Sail ho!&rdquo; startled all on board, and, upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg&nbsp;305]</a></span>
starboard quarter&mdash;loomed a British privateer. Upon
nearer view she was seen to have sixteen guns and
seventy men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All hands for a fight!&rdquo; cried Robinson. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
let th&rsquo; fellow escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now was a hard battle. It lasted for full two hours,
and&mdash;in the end&mdash;the Britisher struck, with twelve
killed and a number wounded, while the American
loss was but one killed and two wounded. The <i>Pomona</i>
kept upon her course, jubilantly.</p>

<p>But the saucy ship was not to have all smooth sailing.
She was soon captured&mdash;by whom it is not
known&mdash;and stout &ldquo;Josh&rdquo; Barney became a prisoner
of war. In December, 1780, with about seventy
American officers, he was placed on board the <i>Yarmouth</i>&mdash;a
sixty-four-gun brig&mdash;and was shipped
to England.</p>

<p>Now listen to the treatment given him according
to a contemporaneous historian. Did you ever hear
of anything more atrocious? Peace&mdash;indeed&mdash;had
more horrors than war in the year 1780.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the time these Americans stepped aboard
the <i>Yarmouth</i> their captors gave it to be understood,
by hints and innuendos, that they were being taken
to England &lsquo;to be hanged as rebels;&rsquo; and, indeed
the treatment they received aboard the <i>Yarmouth</i> on
the passage over, led them to believe that the British
officers intended to cheat the gallows of their prey, by
causing the prisoners to die before they reached port.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On coming aboard the ship-of-the-line, these officers
were stowed away in the lower hold, next to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg&nbsp;306]</a></span>
the keel, under five decks, and many feet below the
water-line. Here, in a twelve-by-twenty-foot room,
with upcurving floor, and only three feet high, the
seventy-one men were kept for fifty-three days, like
so much merchandise&mdash;without light or good air&mdash;unable
to stand upright, with no means to get away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their food was of the poorest quality, and was
supplied in such insufficient quantities, that, whenever
one of the prisoners died, the survivors concealed the
fact, in order that the dead man&rsquo;s allowance might be
added to theirs. The water which they were served
to drink was atrocious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the time the <i>Yarmouth</i> left New York till
she reached Plymouth, in a most tempestuous winter
passage, these men were kept in this loathsome dungeon.
Eleven died in delirium; their wild ravings
and piercing shrieks appalling their comrades, and
giving them a foretaste of what they, themselves,
might expect. Not even a surgeon was permitted to
visit them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arriving at Plymouth, the pale, emaciated men
were ordered to come on deck. Not one obeyed, for
they were unable to stand upright. Consequently
they were hoisted up, the ceremony being grimly suggestive
of the manner in which they had been treated,&mdash;like
merchandise. And what were they to do, now
that they had been placed on deck?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The light of the sun, which they had scarcely seen
for fifty-three days, fell upon their weak, dilated pupils
with blinding force; their limbs were unable to
uphold them, their frames wasted by disease and want.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg&nbsp;307]</a></span>
Seeking for support, they fell in a helpless mass, one
upon the other, waiting and almost hoping for the
blow that was to fall upon them next. Captain Silas
Talbot was one of these unfortunate prisoners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To send them ashore in this condition was &lsquo;impracticable,&rsquo;
so the British officers said, and we readily
discover that this &lsquo;impracticable&rsquo; served the purpose
of diverting the indignation of the land&rsquo;s folk,
which sure would be aroused, if they knew that such
brutality had been practiced under the cross of St.
George (the cross upon the British flag).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waiting, then, until the captives could, at least,
endure the light of day, and could walk without leaning
on one another, or clutching at every object for
support, the officers had them removed to the old Mill
Prison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This story has been denied, for the reason that the
log of the <i>Yarmouth</i> shows that she was forty-four
and not fifty-three days at sea, and the captain writes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had the prisoners &lsquo;watched&rsquo; (divided into
port and starboard watch) and set them to the pumps.
I found it necessary so to employ them, the ship&rsquo;s
company, from their weak and sickly state, being
unequal to that duty, and, on that account to order
them whole allowance of provisions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would have been impossible for men to be in the
condition which the first historian describes if they
had to man the pumps. It would have been impossible
for them to have done an hour&rsquo;s work. Therefore,
I, myself, believe the second story. Don&rsquo;t you?</p>

<p>But to return to stout &ldquo;Josh&rdquo; Barney, now
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg&nbsp;308]</a></span>
meditating thoughts of escape in old Mill Prison. Bold
and resourceful he was always, and he was now determined
to face the difficulties of an exit and the chances
of detection. &ldquo;I must and can get away,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>The prisoners were accustomed to play leap-frog,
and one day the crafty &ldquo;Josh&rdquo; pretended that he had
sprained his ankle. Constructing two crutches&mdash;out
of pieces of boards&mdash;he limped around the prison-yard
and completely deceived all but a few of his
most intimate friends.</p>

<p>One day&mdash;it was May the eighteenth, 1781&mdash;he
passed a sentry near the inner gate. The fellow&rsquo;s name
was Sprokett and he had served in the British army
in America, where he had received many kindnesses
from the country people. For this reason his heart
warmed to the stout, young &ldquo;Josh,&rdquo; who had often
engaged him in conversation.</p>

<p>Hopping to the gate upon his crutches, the youthful
American whispered,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me a British uniform and I will get away.
Can you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sprokett smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this meant one o&rsquo;clock, when the warders
dined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; whispered &ldquo;Josh,&rdquo; smiling broadly,
and he again hobbled around the yard.</p>

<p>After awhile the sentry motioned for him to come
nearer. He did so&mdash;and as he approached&mdash;a large
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg&nbsp;309]</a></span>
bundle was stealthily shoved into his arms. He
hastened to his cell and there put on the undress uniform
of an officer of the British army.</p>

<p>Drawing on his great-coat, he went into the yard
and hobbled about upon his two sticks until the time
drew near for the mid-day mess. Then he drew close
to the gate.</p>

<p>One o&rsquo;clock tolled from the iron bell upon the
prison rampart, and, as its deep-toned echoes sounded
from its tower, several of Barney&rsquo;s friends engaged
the half-dozen sentries in conversation. It was the
time for action.</p>

<p>The astute &ldquo;Josh&rdquo; suddenly dropped his crutches.
Then&mdash;walking across the enclosure towards the
gate,&mdash;he winked to the sentry. A companion was
at hand. With a spring he leaped upon his shoulders.
One boost&mdash;and he was on top of the walk. Another
spring, and he had dropped to the other side as
softly as a cat.</p>

<p>But the second gate and sentry had to be passed.</p>

<p>Walking up to this red-coated individual he placed
four guineas (about $20.00) into his outstretched
palm. The soldier smiled grimly, as the great-coat
was tossed aside, and the shrewdest privateer in the
American Navy walked towards the opening through
the outer wall, which was usually left ajar for the
convenience of the prison officials. Another sentry
stood upon duty at this point.</p>

<p>Barney nodded. The sentry had been &ldquo;squared&rdquo;
(told of the coming escape) and so he turned his back.
Thus&mdash;with his heart beating like a trip-hammer&mdash;&ldquo;Josh,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg&nbsp;310]</a></span>
the nervy one&mdash;walked down the cobbled
street outside of the &ldquo;Old Mill.&rdquo; He was free.</p>

<p>Dodging into a lane, he soon met a friend who had
been told of his attempt, and who took him to the
house of an old clergyman in Plymouth. In the morning,
with two fellow-countrymen, who were also in
hiding (for they had been captured as passengers in
a merchant vessel), he secured a fishing-smack.
&ldquo;Josh&rdquo; now covered his uniform. Putting on an
old coat with a tarred rope tied around his waist, a
pair of torn trousers, and a tarpaulin hat, the disguised
Jack-tar ran the little vessel down the River
Plym, just as day was dawning. The forts and men-of-war
were safely passed, and the little shallop tossed
upon the gleaming wavelets of the English channel.</p>

<p>We are told that his escape was not noticed for some
time because &ldquo;a slender youth who was capable of
creeping through the window-bars at pleasure crawled
into Barney&rsquo;s cell (in the Old Mill Prison) and answered
for him.&rdquo; I doubt this, for&mdash;if you have
ever seen the bars of a prison&mdash;it would take a Jack
Spratt to get through them, and Jack Spratts are not
common. At any rate someone answered to the daily
roll-call for Joshua B., so that it was full two weeks
before the authorities knew of his escape. Perhaps
there was a ventriloquist in the jail.</p>

<p>The tiny boat in which the adventurous American
hoped to reach the welcome shores of France, bobbed
up and down, as she ambled towards the low-lying
coast, under a gentle southerly breeze. But there was
trouble in this self-same wind, for the white wings
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg&nbsp;311]</a></span>
of a British privateer grew nearer and nearer, and a
hail soon came:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name, and where are you bound?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barney and his partners in distress did not answer
at all. They scowled as a boat was lowered from the
side of their pursuer, and quickly splashed towards
them. In not many moments, a swearing sea-captain
swung himself upon their deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you, you lubbers?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;
yer papers, and where&rsquo; yer bound to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a British officer,&rdquo; replied the astute Joshua,
opening his coat and disclosing the uniform of the
service. &ldquo;I am bound for France upon official business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Captain snickered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; with two others in er&rsquo; launch? Aw go tell
that to th&rsquo; marines!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s truth. I&rsquo;m in a state secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wall&mdash;be that as it may be&mdash;you must come
aboard of my vessel and tell yer state secret to th&rsquo;
authorities in England. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ll put a skipper
of my own aboard yer vessel and we&rsquo;ll travel together&mdash;bein&rsquo;
friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barney swore beneath his breath.</p>

<p>Thus the two boats beat towards the coast of Merrie
England in company, and upon the day following,
came to anchor in a small harbor, six miles from
Plymouth. The captain of the privateer went ashore
in order to report to Admiral Digby at Plymouth,
while most of the crew also hastened to the beach in
order to avoid the chance of being seized by the press-gang,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg&nbsp;312]</a></span>
which harried incoming vessels for recruits for
His Majesty&rsquo;s service.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go, too?&rdquo; asked the cautious &ldquo;Josh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you must remain on board until we come for
you,&rdquo; said the captain, as he jumped into his boat en
route for the shore. &ldquo;Mister Officer, I want to search
your record.&rdquo; Then he laughed brutishly.</p>

<p>But Barney&rsquo;s thinking cap was working like a mill
race. There was a jolly-boat tied to the stern of the
privateer, and, when all were safe ashore, he gently
slipped into this, purposely skinning his leg as he did
so. Then he sculled to the beach; where a group of
idlers stood looking out to sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he cried, as he neared them. &ldquo;Help me
haul up this boat, will yer? She&rsquo;s awful heavy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A custom&rsquo;s officer was among these loiterers and he
was inquisitive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What regiment and
where stationed, pray?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I cannot answer, my friend,&rdquo; calmly replied
the acute &ldquo;Josh,&rdquo; pointing to the blood as it trickled
through his stocking. &ldquo;I am badly injured, you see,
and must go away in order to get my leg tied up.
Prithee, kind sir, can you tell me where the crew from
my vessel have gone to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are at the Red Lion at the end of the village,&rdquo;
replied the official of the law. &ldquo;You are, indeed,
badly hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wall, I reckon,&rdquo; replied the American, and, stumbling
up the beach, he was soon headed for the end
of the little village.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg&nbsp;313]</a></span>
But things were not to go too well with him. He
found that he was obliged to pass the Red Lion, and
he had almost succeeded in doing so unmolested, when
one of the sailors who was loitering outside, cried
out after him,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho, friend! I would speak with you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Josh&rdquo; had to stop although sorely tempted to run
for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some idee of shippin&rsquo; in th&rsquo; Navy,&rdquo; said
the fellow, as he approached. &ldquo;Now, friend, you can
tell me somethin&rsquo; of th&rsquo; pay an&rsquo; service, as you&rsquo;re an
officer of th&rsquo; army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barney&rsquo;s eyes shone with pleasure, as he saw that
his disguise had deceived the fellow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walk along with me towards Plymouth,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll explain everything to you. I have business
there which will not wait and I must get on
to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they jogged along together, talking vigorously
about the Navy, but, in the course of half an hour
the jack-tar seemed to think better of his plan for
entering &ldquo;a service noted for its cruelty to seamen,&rdquo;
and turned back, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank&rsquo;ee my fine friend. Thank&rsquo;ee. I&rsquo;ll stick to
privateerin&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s easier an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s less cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails
to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as his burly form disappeared down the
winding road, Barney began to grow anxious about
his safety. Perhaps a guard would be sent after him?
Perhaps&mdash;even now&mdash;men had discovered his absence
and were hurrying to intercept him? So&mdash;with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg&nbsp;314]</a></span>
these thoughts upon his mind&mdash;he jumped over
a stiff hedge into the grounds of Lord Mount-Edgecumbe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egad! it&rsquo;s touch and go with me,&rdquo; said he, as he
walked down one of the gravelled paths. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in
for it now for here comes the gardener.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, towards him ambled a middle-aged
fellow, smiling as he pushed along a wheel-barrow
filled with bulbs.</p>

<p>Joshua walked up to him, extending his right
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am an officer escaping
from some seamen who wish my life because of a
duel in which I recently engaged over the hand of a
fair lady. Here is a guinea. It is all that I possess.
And&mdash;if you could but pilot me to the waterside and
will not tell of my whereabouts&mdash;I will bless you to
my dying day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The good-humored man-of-the-soil smiled benignly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prithee, but follow me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll soon
see that you pass by the way of the water gate. Your
money is most welcome, sir, for my wife is just now
ill and doctors must be paid, sir. That you know
right well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barney breathed easier as they walked towards the
sea; for out of the corner of his eye he saw a
guard&mdash;sent to capture him&mdash;tramping along
the other side of the hedge over which he had
leaped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye and good luck!&rdquo; cried the kind-hearted
servant as he closed the private gate which led to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg&nbsp;315]</a></span>
waterside. And, with a wave of the hand, the fleeing
American was soon hastening to the winding river,
over which he must cross in order to get on to Plymouth.</p>

<p>Luck was still with him. A butcher who was ferrying
some beeves by water, took him in his boat, and,
as night fell, the keen-witted privateersman crept
through the back door of the old clergyman&rsquo;s house
at Plymouth&mdash;from which he had started. For the
time being, he was safe.</p>

<p>Strange to relate, the two friends of the fishing-smack
adventure here joined him once more, for they,
also, had run away from the crew of the privateer,
and&mdash;as they sat around the supper-table&mdash;the town-crier
went by the house, bawling in harsh and discordant
tones:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five guineas reward for the capture of Joshua
Barney; a rebel deserter from Mill Prison! Five
guineas reward for this deserter! Five guineas! Five
guineas!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Barney stuffed his napkin into his mouth in
order to stop his laughter.</p>

<p>Three days later a clean-shaven, bright-cheeked,
young dandy stepped into a post chaise, at midnight,
and drove off to Exeter. At Plymouth gate the conveyance
was stopped; a lantern was thrust into the
black interior; and the keen eyes of the guard scanned
the visages of those within:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; growled the watchman, lowering
the light. &ldquo;Drive on!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus Joshua Barney rolled on to home and freedom,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg&nbsp;316]</a></span>
while the stout-bodied soldier little guessed that
the artful privateersman had slipped through his fingers
like water through a sieve.</p>

<p>Two months later&mdash;in the autumn of 1781&mdash;Joshua
Barney: fighter, privateer, liar and fugitive,
walked down the quiet streets of Beverly, Massachusetts,
and a little fish-monger&rsquo;s son whispered to his companions,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Boys! That feller is a Jim Dandy. He&rsquo;s
been through more&rsquo;n we&rsquo;ll ever see. Say! He&rsquo;s a
regular Scorcher!&rdquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Many months later&mdash;when the Revolutionary War
had ended&mdash;the good ship <i>General Washington</i> lay
in Plymouth Harbor on the south coast of England.
Her commander&mdash;Captain Joshua Barney&mdash;gazed
contentedly at the Stars and Stripes as they flew
jauntily from the mizzen-mast, and then walked to
the rail, as a group of British officers came over the
side. But there was one among these guests who was
not an officer. He was bent, old, weather-beaten;
and his dress showed him to be a tiller and worker
of the soil. It was the aged and faithful gardener of
Lord Mount-Edgecumbe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember me?&rdquo; cried the genial American,
grasping the honest servant by the hand.</p>

<p>The gardener&rsquo;s eyes were alight with pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the feller who jumped over the hedge&mdash;many
years ago&mdash;when the sea-dogs were hot upon
your trail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joshua Barney chuckled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg&nbsp;317]</a></span>
&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And here is a purse of
gold to reward my kind and worthy helpmeet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he placed a heavy, chamois bag of glittering
eagles into the trembling hands of the ancient
retainer.</p>

<span class="i0">For &ldquo;Bobbie&rdquo; Surcouf has just come to town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Tenez!</em> He&rsquo;s worthy of wearing a crown.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was a sweltering, hot day in July and the good
ship <i>Aurora</i> swung lazily in the torpid waters of
the Indian Ocean. Her decks fairly sizzled in the
sun, and her sails flopped like huge planks of wood.
She was becalmed on a sheet of molten brass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand this any longer,&rdquo; said a young fellow
with black hair and swarthy skin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going overboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From his voice it was easy to see he was a Frenchman.</p>

<p>Hastily stripping himself, he went to the gangway,
and standing upon the steps, took a header into the
oily brine. He did not come up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sacre nom de Dieu!&rdquo; cried a sailor. &ldquo;Young
Surcouf be no risen. Ah! He has been down ze long
time. Ah! Let us lower ze boat and find heem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Voil&agrave;! Voil&agrave;!&rdquo; cried another. &ldquo;He ees
drowned!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg&nbsp;322]</a></span>
<em>Plunkety, plunk, splash!</em> went a boat over the side,
and in a moment more, a half dozen sailors were
eagerly looking into the deep, blue wash of the ocean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He no there. I will dive for heem,&rdquo; cried out the
fellow who had first spoken, and, leaping from the
boat, he disappeared from view.</p>

<p>In a few moments he re-appeared, drawing the body
of the first diver with him. It was apparently helpless.
The prostrate sailor was lifted to the deck;
rubbed, worked over, scrubbed,&mdash;but no signs of
life were there.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a Portuguese Lieutenant, who was
pacing the poop, appeared to be much pleased at what
took place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fellow&rsquo;s dead! The beggar&rsquo;s done for,&mdash;sure.
Overboard with the rascal! To the waves with
the dead &rsquo;un!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give us a few more moments,&rdquo; cried the sailors.
&ldquo;He will come to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Lieutenant smiled satirically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the waves with the corpse! To the sharks
with the man from St. Malo!&rdquo; cried he.</p>

<p>And all of this the senseless seaman heard&mdash;for&mdash;he
was in a cataleptic fit, where he could hear, but
could not move. The Portuguese Lieutenant and he
were bitter enemies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I tell you, Boys, the fellow&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo; again
cried the Portuguese. &ldquo;Over with him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he seized the inert body with his hands;
dragged it to the ship&rsquo;s side; and started to lift it to
the rail.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg&nbsp;323]</a></span>
Conscious of all that went on around him, the paralyzed
Surcouf realized that, unless he could make some
sign, he had only a few seconds to live. So, with a
tremendous effort&mdash;he made a movement of his limbs.
It was noticed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Voil&agrave;! Voil&agrave;!&rdquo; cried a French sailor. &ldquo;He ees
alife. No! No! You cannot kill heem!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Running forward, he grabbed the prostrate form of
Robert Surcouf, pulled it back upon the deck, and&mdash;as
the Portuguese Lieutenant went off cursing&mdash;he
rubbed the cold hands of the half-senseless man. In a
moment the supposed corpse had opened its eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I had a close call. A thousand
thanks to all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In five more moments he could stand upon the deck,
and&mdash;believe me&mdash;he did not forget the Portuguese
Lieutenant!</p>

<p>Robert Surcouf was born at St. Malo&mdash;just one
hundred years after Du Guay-Trouin, to whom he
was related. And like his famous relative he had been
intended for the Church,&mdash;but he was always fighting;
was insubordinate, and could not be made to
study. In fact, he was what is known as a &ldquo;holy
terror.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally good Mamma Surcouf sent him to the Seminary
of St. Dinan, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Robert, be a good boy and study hard thy
lessons!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Robert said, &ldquo;Oui, Madame!&rdquo; But he would
not work.</p>

<p>One day the master in arithmetic did not like the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg&nbsp;324]</a></span>
method in which young &ldquo;Bobbie&rdquo; answered him,
and raising a cane, he ran towards the youthful
scholar. But Robert had learned a kind of &ldquo;Jiu-Jitsu&rdquo;
practiced by the youths of France, and he
tackled his irate master like an end-rush upon the
foot-ball team, when he dives for a runner. Both fell
to the ground with a thud. And all the other boys
yelled &ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; in unison.</p>

<p>Now was a fierce battle, but weight told, and
&ldquo;Bobbie&rdquo; was soon underneath, with his teeth in the
leg of his tutor. They scratched and rolled until
&ldquo;Bobbie&rdquo; freed himself, and, running to the window,
jumped outside&mdash;for he was on the ground floor&mdash;scaled
the garden fence, and made off. Home was
twenty miles away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must get there, somehow,&rdquo; said young &ldquo;Bobbie.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I can never go back. I will be spanked so that I
cannot seat myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So little &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; trudged onward in the snow, for
it was winter. It grew dark. It was bitterly cold, and
he had no hat. At length&mdash;worn out with cold and
hunger&mdash;he sank senseless to the roadside.</p>

<p>Luck pursues those destined for greatness.</p>

<p>Some fish-merchants happened that way, and, seeing
the poor, helpless, little boy, they picked him up;
placed him upon a tiny dog-cart; and carried him to
St. Malo, where he had a severe attack of pneumonia.
But his good mother nursed him through, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ta donc! He will never be a scholar. Ta donc!
Young Robbie must go to sea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So when &ldquo;Bobbie&rdquo; was well he was shipped aboard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg&nbsp;325]</a></span>
the brig <i>Heron</i>, bound for Cadiz, Spain&mdash;and he was
only just thirteen. But he threw up his cap crying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is just what I&rsquo;ve always wanted. Hurrah
for the salty brine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At about twenty years of age we find him upon the
good ship <i>Aurora</i> from which his dive into the Indian
Ocean came near being his last splash. And the Portuguese
Lieutenant did not forget.</p>

<p>Upon the next visit of the cruiser <i>Aurora</i> to the
coast of Africa an epidemic of malarial fever struck
the crew. Among those who succumbed to the disease
was the Portuguese Lieutenant. He was dangerously
ill.</p>

<p>The ship arrived at the island of Mauritius, and,
Lieutenant Robert Surcouf was just going ashore,
when he received a message which said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and see me. I am very ill.&rdquo; It was from
his enemy,&mdash;the Portuguese.</p>

<p>Surcouf did not like the idea, but after thinking the
matter over, he went. But note this,&mdash;he had a pair
of loaded pistols in his pocket. Dead men&mdash;you know&mdash;tell
no tales.</p>

<p>As he entered the sick man&rsquo;s cabin, a servant was
there. The Portuguese made a sign to him to retire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish to speak to you with a sincere heart,&rdquo; said
he, turning his face to young Surcouf. &ldquo;Before I pass
from this world I want to relieve my conscience, and
ask your forgiveness for all the evil which I have
wished you during our voyages together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I bear you no malice,&rdquo; said Surcouf. &ldquo;Let by-gones
be by-gones.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg&nbsp;326]</a></span>
As he spoke a spasm seemed to contort the body of
the dying man. One arm stretched out towards a
pillow nearby, and Robert had a sudden, but excellent
thought. Stepping forward, he seized the hand of his
old enemy, lifted the pillow, and, then started back
with an exclamation of astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye Gods!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;You would murder me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There, before him, were two cocked and loaded
pistols.</p>

<p>Leaping forward he grabbed the weapons, pointing
one at the forehead of the rascally sailor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You miserable beast!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;I can now
shoot you like a dog, or squash you like an insect;
but I despise you too much. I will leave you to die
like a coward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; says a historian, &ldquo;this is what the wretched
man did,&mdash;blaspheming in despairing rage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In October, 1794, Lieutenant Surcouf saw his first
big battle, for, the English being at war with the
French, two British men-of-war hovered off the island
of Mauritius, blockading the port of St. Thomas.
They were the <i>Centurion</i> of fifty-four guns, and the
<i>Diomede</i>, also of fifty-four cannon, but with fewer
tars. The French had four ships of war: the <i>Prudente</i>,
forty guns; the <i>Cybele</i>, forty-four guns; the
<i>Jean Bart</i>, twenty guns; and the <i>Courier</i>, fourteen
guns. Surcouf was junior Lieutenant aboard the
<i>Cybele</i>.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful, clear day, as the French vessels
ploughed out to battle; their sails aquiver with the
soft breeze; their pennons fluttering; guns flashing;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg&nbsp;327]</a></span>
and eager sailors crowding to the rails with cutlasses
newly sharpened and pistols in their sashes.</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em></p>

<p>The first gun spoke. The first shell spun across the
bow of the British bull-dog <i>Diomede</i>, and the battle
was on.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a school of pollock chasing a
school of smaller fry? Have you ever seen them
jump and splash, and thud upon the surface of the
water?</p>

<p>Well&mdash;that is the way that the shells looked and
sounded&mdash;as they plumped and slushed into the surface
of the southern sea; and every now and then there
was a <em>punk</em>, and a <em>crash</em>, and a <em>chug</em>, as a big, iron ball
bit into the side of a man-of-war.</p>

<p>Around and around sailed the sparring assailants,
each looking for a chance to board. <em>Crash! Roar!
Crash!</em> growled the broadsides. Shrill screams
sounded from the wounded; the harsh voices of the
officers echoed above the din of the conflict; and, the
whining bugle squealed ominously between the roaring
crush of grape and chain-shot.</p>

<p>But the French got nearer and nearer. Great gaps
showed in the bulwarks of the <i>Diomede</i>; one mast
was tottering. Beaten and outnumbered she stood out
to sea, her sailors crowding into the rigging like
monkeys, and spreading every stitch of white canvas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She runs! Egad, she runs!&rdquo; cried the Commander
of the other British vessel. &ldquo;Faith, I cannot
stand off four Frenchmen alone. I must after her
to save my scalp.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg&nbsp;328]</a></span>
So&mdash;putting his helm hard over&mdash;he threw his
vessel before the wind, and she spun off, pursued by
bouncing shells and shrieking grapnel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Voil&agrave;!&rdquo; cried the French. &ldquo;Ze great battaile,
eet belongs to us!&rdquo; But there were many dead and
wounded upon the decks of the proud French warships.</p>

<p>Soon after this smart, little affair the soldiers and
sailors who had been in this fight were discharged,&mdash;and&mdash;looking
about for employment, young Robert
took the first position that presented itself: the command
of the brig <i>Creole</i>,&mdash;engaged in the slave trade.
He made several successful voyages, but orders were
issued to&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Arrest the Slave Hunter and all his crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they arrive at the Mauritius.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>One of those little birds which sometimes carry
needed information, both on sea and land, whispered
this ill news to the gallant, young sea-dog. So he
steered for the isle of Bourbon, and there landed his
human freight in a small bay. At daybreak he lay at
anchor in the Harbor of St. Paul in that self-same
island.</p>

<p>About eight in the morning a boat was seen approaching,
and to the hail,&mdash;&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;
came the reply&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Public Health Committee from St. Denis. We
wish to come on board and to inspect your ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surcouf was much annoyed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg&nbsp;329]</a></span>
&ldquo;You can climb aboard,&rdquo; said he, stifling an exclamation
of disgust. &ldquo;I am at your service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few moments the commissioners were upon the
deck, and, in a few moments more, they had discovered
that the ship was a slaver.</p>

<p>Turning to the youthful captain, one of the committee
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, sir, are engaged in illegal traffic. You must
suffer for this, and must come with us at once to the
city to answer an indictment drawn up against you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surcouf smiled benignly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am at your service,&rdquo; said he, with a polite bow.
&ldquo;But do not go&mdash;I pray thee&mdash;until you have given
me the great pleasure of partaking of the breakfast
which my cook has hastily prepared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Committee-men smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;We accept with
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hasty efforts of the cook proved to be most
attractive. And, as the Commissioners smacked their
lips over the good Madeira wine, the mate of the <i>Creole</i>
dismissed the boat which had brought the stolid Commissioners
to the side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tender of our brig will take your people
ashore,&rdquo; said he to the coxswain.</p>

<p>No sooner had this tender neared the shore, than the
cable of the <i>Creole</i> was slipped; she left her anchorage;
and quickly drew out to sea in a fresh sou&rsquo;westerly
breeze.</p>

<p>The unaccustomed rallying soon warned the Commissioners
that the vessel was no longer at anchor,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg&nbsp;330]</a></span>
and, rushing to the deck, they saw&mdash;with dismay&mdash;that
a full half mile of foam-flecked ocean lay between
them and the island.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye Gods!&rdquo; cried one, turning to Surcouf.
&ldquo;What mean you by this, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crafty Captain was smiling like the Cheshire
cat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are now in my power,&rdquo; said he&mdash;very
slowly and deliberately. &ldquo;I am going to take you
to the coast of Africa among your friends&mdash;the
negroes. You seem to prefer them to the whites, so
why not, pray? Meanwhile,&mdash;my kind sirs,&mdash;come
below and take my orders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Commissioners were flabbergasted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pirate!&rdquo; cried one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thief!&rdquo; cried another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scamp!&rdquo; shouted the third.</p>

<p>But they went below,&mdash;mumbling many an imprecation
upon the head of the crafty Robert Surcouf.</p>

<p>That night the wind freshened, the waves rose, and
the good ship <i>Creole</i> pitched and tossed upon them,
like a leaf. The Committee-men were very ill, for they
were landsmen, and Surcouf&rsquo;s smile expanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take us ashore! Take us ashore!&rdquo; cried one.
&ldquo;We <em>must</em> get upon land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surcouf even laughed. Everything was as he
wished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will land you upon one condition only,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Destroy the indictment against me and my ship.
Write a document to the effect that you have found
no traces of slaves upon my staunch craft. Say that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg&nbsp;331]</a></span>
my boat was driven from her anchor by a tidal wave&mdash;and
you can put your feet upon solid ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three Commissioners scowled, but he had them.
Besides they were sea-sick.</p>

<p>In an hour&rsquo;s time, the desired paper had been drawn
up. The <i>Creole</i> was headed for the Mauritius,&mdash;and,
in eight days, the sad but wiser Commissioners were
brooding over the smartness of Robert Surcouf when
seated in their own snug little homes. &ldquo;He is a rascal,&rdquo;
said one. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a slick and wily cur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So much reputation came to the young mariner&mdash;at
this exploit&mdash;that he was soon offered the command
of the <i>Emilie</i>: a privateer of one hundred and
eighty tons and four guns. He accepted with glee,
but when about to go to sea, the Governor refused
him Letters of Marque.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; asked the crest-fallen Robert,
approaching the owners of the trim and able
craft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sail for the Seychelles (Islands off the east coast
of Africa) for a cargo of turtles,&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;If you
fail to find these; fill up with corn, cotton and fruit.
Fight shy of all English cruisers, and battle if you
have to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surcouf bowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a regular privateer,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;For
I have no Letters of Marque. But I can defend myself
if fired upon, and am an armed vessel in war-time. I
may yet see some fighting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was not to be disappointed.</p>

<p>While at anchor at the Seychelles, two large and fat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg&nbsp;332]</a></span>
English men-of-war appeared in the offing. Surcouf
had to run for it.</p>

<p>Steering in among the many little islets, which here
abound, he navigated the dangerous channels and got
safely off, his men crying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Voil&agrave;! Here is a genius. We did well to ship
with such a master!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the gallant Surcouf soon turned from privateer
to pirate.</p>

<p>South of the Bay of Bengal, a cyclone struck the
<i>Emilie</i> and she was steered for Rangoon, where&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The flying fishes play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An&rsquo; the dawn comes up like thunder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outer China across the Bay.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And here a British vessel steered for her: white-winged,
saucy, vindictive-looking.</p>

<p>She came on valiantly, and, when within a hundred
yards, pumped a shot across the bow of the
drowsing <i>Emilie</i>. It meant &ldquo;Show your colors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hoisting the red, white and blue of France, Surcouf
replied with three scorching shots. One struck
the Britisher amid-ships, and pumped a hole in her
black boarding.</p>

<p>Like a timid girl, the Englishman veered off,
hoisted her topsail, and tried to get away. She saw
that she had caught a tartar.</p>

<p>The blood was up of the &ldquo;Man from St. Malo.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
consider the shot across my bows as an attack,&rdquo; said
he, and he slapped on every stitch of canvas, so that
the <i>Emilie</i> was soon abreast of the Britisher. <em>Boom!</em>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg&nbsp;333]</a></span>
A broadside roared into her and she struck her colors.
Bold Robert Surcouf had passed the Rubicon,&mdash;he
had seen the English flag lowered to him, for the first
time; and his heart swelled with patriotic pride, in
spite of the fact that this was an act of piracy, for
which he could be hanged to the yard-arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On! On!&rdquo; cried Surcouf. &ldquo;More captures!
More prizes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three days later three vessels carrying rice fell into
his hands,&mdash;one of which,&mdash;a pilot-brig&mdash;was appropriated
in place of the <i>Emilie</i>, which had a foul,
barnacled bottom and had lost her speed. The <i>Diana</i>,
another rice-carrier&mdash;was also captured&mdash;and Robert
Surcouf headed for the Mauritius: pleased and
happy.</p>

<p>A few days later, as the vessels pottered along off
the river Hooghly, the cry came:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A large sail standing into Balasore Roads!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a moment Surcouf had clapped his glass to his
keen and searching eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An East Indiaman,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And rich, I&rsquo;ll
warrant. Ready about and make after her. She&rsquo;s too
strong for us,&mdash;that I see&mdash;but we may outwit
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vessel, in fact, was the <i>Triton</i>, with six-and-twenty
guns and a strong crew. Surcouf had but
nineteen men aboard, including the surgeon and himself,
and a few Lascars,&mdash;natives. The odds were
heavily against him, but his nerve was as adamant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My own boat has been a pilot-brig. Up with the
pilot flag!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg&nbsp;334]</a></span>
As the little piece of bunting fluttered in the breeze,
the <i>Triton</i> hove to, and waited for him, as unsuspecting
as could be. Surcouf chuckled.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came his own vessel to the lolling
Indiaman, and, as she rolled within hailing distance,
the bold French sea-dog saw &ldquo;<i>beaucoup de monde</i>&rdquo;&mdash;a
great crowd of people&mdash;upon the deck of the Englishman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lads!&rdquo; cried he, turning to his crew. &ldquo;This
<i>Triton</i> is very strong. We are only nineteen. Shall
we try to take her by surprise and thus acquire both
gain and glory? Or, do you prefer to rot in a beastly
English prison-ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Death or victory!&rdquo; cried the Frenchmen.</p>

<p>Surcouf smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This ship shall either be our tomb, or the cradle
of our glory,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crew and passengers of the <i>Triton</i> saw only a
pilot-brig approaching, as these did habitually (to
within twenty or thirty feet) in order to transfer the
pilot. Suddenly a few uttered exclamations of surprise
and dismay. The French colors rose to the mast of
the sorrowful-looking pilot-boat, and with a flash and
a roar, a heavy dose of canister and grape ploughed
into the unsuspecting persons upon the deck of the
Indiaman. Many sought shelter from the hail of
iron.</p>

<p>A moment more, and the brig was alongside. A
crunching: a splitting of timber as the privateer struck
and ground into the bulwarks of the <i>Triton</i>, and, with
a wild yell&mdash;Surcouf leaped upon the deck of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg&nbsp;335]</a></span>
adversary&mdash;followed by his eighteen men, with cutlass,
dirks and pistols.</p>

<p>There was but little resistance. The Captain of
the <i>Triton</i> seized a sword and made a vain attempt to
stem the onslaught of the boarders, but he was immediately
cut down. The rest were driven below, and
the hatches clapped tight above them. In five minutes
the affair was over, with five killed and six wounded
upon the side of the English: one killed and one
wounded among the French. Surcouf had made a
master stroke. The <i>Triton</i> was his own.</p>

<p>The many prisoners were placed on board the <i>Diana</i>
and allowed to make their way to Calcutta, but the
<i>Triton</i> was triumphantly steered to the Mauritius,
where Surcouf received a tremendous ovation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Robert Surcouf: the sea-hound from
St. Malo!&rdquo; shrieked the townsfolk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your captures are all condemned,&rdquo; said the Governor
of the island, a few days after his triumphant
arrival. &ldquo;For you sailed and fought not under a
Letter of Marque, so you are a pirate and not a privateer.
Those who go a-pirating must pay the piper.
Your prizes belong to the Government of France, and
its representative. I hereby seize them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Surcouf was nonplussed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will take this matter to France, itself,&rdquo; cried
he. &ldquo;And we shall see whether or no all my exertions
shall go for nought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the case was referred to the French courts, where
Robert appeared in person to plead his cause. And
the verdict was:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg&nbsp;336]</a></span>
&ldquo;The captures of Captain Robert Surcouf of St.
Malo are all declared &lsquo;good prize&rsquo; and belong to him
and the owners of his vessel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the wild man from St. Malo was very happy, and
he and his owners pocketed a good, round sum of
money. But he really was a pirate and not a privateer.
<em>Tenez!</em> He had the money, at any rate, so why should
he care?</p>

<p>The remaining days of Robert&rsquo;s life were full of
battle, and, just a little love, for he returned to his
native town during the progress of the law-suit&mdash;in
order to see his family and his friends, and there
became engaged to Mlle. Marie Blaize, who was as
good as she was pretty. But the sea sang a song which
ran:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;For men must work and women must weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The home of a hero is on the deep.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>which the stout sea-dog could not resist. So he left
the charming demoiselle without being married, and
&rsquo;tis said that she wept bitterly.</p>

<p>Now came his greatest exploit.</p>

<p>On October 7th, 1800, the hardy mariner&mdash;in command
of the <i>Confiance</i>; a new vessel with one hundred
and thirty souls aboard&mdash;was cruising off the Indian
coast. He had a Letter of Marque this time, so all
would go well with him if he took a prize. The opportunity
soon came. A sail was sighted early that
day, and Surcouf scanned her carefully through his
glass.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;">
<a name="surcouf_scanned_her" id="surcouf_scanned_her"></a>
<img src="images/fpas20.jpg" width="383" height="600" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;SURCOUF SCANNED HER CAREFULLY THROUGH HIS GLASS.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a rich prize,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;An Indiaman. All
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg&nbsp;337]</a></span>
hands on deck. Make sail! Drinks all round for the
men! Clear for action!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke this to himself, for he was aloft, and,
climbing to the deck, ordered everybody aft to listen
to a speech. When they had collected there, he said,
with feeling:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose each one of you is more than equal to
one Englishman? Very good&mdash;be armed and ready
for boarding&mdash;and, as it is going to be hot work, I&rsquo;ll
give you one hour for pillage. You can fight, and,
behind me, you should be invincible! Strike, and strike
hard; and you will be rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The <i>Kent</i> had four hundred and thirty-seven souls
aboard, says an old chronicler, for she had picked up
a great part of the crew of the <i>Queen</i>: an East Indiaman
which had been destroyed off the coast of Brazil.
Her Captain&rsquo;s name was Rivington and he was a fellow
of heroic courage.</p>

<p>As the <i>Confiance</i> drew near, the crew of the Englishman
gave her a fair broadside and pumped gun after
gun into her hull. But the Frenchman held her fire,
and bore in close, in order to grapple. Hoarse shouts
sounded above the roar of the guns and the splitting
of timber, as the two war-dogs closed for action. The
crew of the <i>Kent</i> were poorly armed and undisciplined:
they had never fought together. With Surcouf it was
far different. His sailors were veterans&mdash;they had
boarded many a merchantman and privateer before&mdash;and,
they were well used to this gallant pastime. Besides,
each had a boarding-axe, a cutlass,&mdash;pistol and
a dagger&mdash;to say nothing of a blunderbuss loaded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg&nbsp;338]</a></span>
with six bullets, pikes fifteen feet long, and enormous
clubs&mdash;all of this with &ldquo;drinks all round&rdquo; and the
promise of pillage. No wonder they could fight!</p>

<p>With a wild, ear-splitting whoop the wild men of
the French privateer finally leaped over the rail&mdash;upon
the deck of the Englishman&mdash;and there was fierce
struggling for possession of her. At the head of his
men, Rivington fought like a true Briton,&mdash;cutlass in
hand, teeth clinched, eyes to the front. He was magnificent.</p>

<p>But what could one man do against many?</p>

<p>Back, back, the French forced the valiant lion, while
his crew fell all about in tiers, and, at length, they
drove him to the poop. He was bleeding from many
a wound. He was fast sinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up the ship!&rdquo; he cried, casting his eye
aloft at the red ensign of his country.</p>

<p>Then he fell upon his face, and the maddened followers
of Surcouf swept over the decking like followers
of Attila, the terrible Hun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spare the women!&rdquo; shouted the French Captain
above the din&mdash;and roar of battle. &ldquo;Pillage; but spare
the women!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was well that he had spoken, for his cut-throats
were wild with the heat of battle. In twenty minutes
the <i>Kent</i> was helpless; her crew were prisoners; and
the saucy pennon of France fluttered where once had
waved the proud ensign of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Surcouf was happy. Landing the English prisoners
in an Arab vessel, he arrived at the Mauritius with his
prize in November, and soon took his doughty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg&nbsp;339]</a></span>
<i>Confiance</i> to the low shores of France, catching a Portuguese
merchant en route, and anchoring at La
Rochelle, on April 13th, 1801.</p>

<p>Rich, famous, respected; he now married the good
Mlle. Marie Blaize, and became the owner of privateers
and a respected citizen of the Fatherland. Fortune
had favored this brave fellow.</p>

<p>As a prosperous ship-owner and ship-builder of his
native village&mdash;&ldquo;the Sea-Hound of St. Malo&rdquo;&mdash;closed
his adventurous life in the year 1827. And
when he quietly passed away, the good housewives
used to mutter:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look you! Here was a man who fought the English
as well as they themselves could fight. He was
a true son of William the Conqueror. Look you!
This was a King of the Ocean!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the gulls wheeled over the grave of the doughty
sea-warrior, shrieking,</p>

<p>&ldquo;He-did-it! He-did-it! He-did-it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>APTAIN, we can&rsquo;t live much longer unless
we have food. We&rsquo;ve got enough to last
us for two weeks&rsquo; time, and then&mdash;if we
do not get fresh provisions&mdash;we&rsquo;ll have to eat the
sails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fellow who spoke was a rough-looking sea-dog,
with a yellow face&mdash;parched and wrinkled by many
years of exposure&mdash;a square figure; a red handkerchief
tied about his black hair; a sash about his waist
in which was stuck a brace of evil-barrelled pistols.
He looked grimly at the big-boned man before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. You are right, as usual, Gascon. We&rsquo;ve
got to strike a foreign sail before the week is out, and
capture her. And I, Lafitte, must turn from privateer
to pirate. May my good mother at St. Malo have
mercy on my soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg&nbsp;344]</a></span>
And, so saying, he turned to pace restlessly upon the
sloping deck of the two-hundred-ton barque which
boiled along under a spread of bellying canvas, and
was guided by the keen eye of this youthful mariner.
He came from the same little town in France which
sheltered the good mother of Du Guay-Trouin, the
great French &ldquo;blue.&rdquo; His name was Jean Lafitte.</p>

<p>This sea-rover had been born in 1781, and had taken
to the ocean at the age of thirteen, when most boys are
going to boarding-school. After several voyages in
Europe, and to the coast of Africa, he was appointed
mate of a French East Indiaman, bound to Madras in
India. But things did not go any too well with the
sturdy ship; a heavy gale struck her off the Cape of
Good Hope; she sprung her mainmast, and&mdash;flopping
along like a huge sea-turtle&mdash;staggered into the
port of St. Thomas in the island of Mauritius, off the
east coast of Africa.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said young Lafitte to his Captain, &ldquo;is
where I leave you, for you are a bully, a braggart, and
a knave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, so saying, he cut for shore in the jolly-boat,
but&mdash;if the truth must be known&mdash;Lafitte and the
Captain were too much alike to get on together. They
both wished to &ldquo;be boss.&rdquo; Like magnets do not attract,
but repel.</p>

<p>Luck was with the young deserter. Several privateers
were being fitted out at the safe port of St.
Thomas and he was appointed Captain of one of them.
Letters of Marque were granted by the Governor of
the Mauritius.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg&nbsp;345]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ah ha!&rdquo; cried the youthful adventurer. &ldquo;Now
I can run things to suit myself. And I&rsquo;ll grow
rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This he speedily succeeded in doing, for, in the
course of his cruise, he robbed several vessels which
came in his path, and, stopping at the Seychelles
(Islands off the eastern coast of Africa), took on a
load of slaves for the port of St. Thomas. Thus he
had descended&mdash;not only to piracy&mdash;but also to
slave catching; the lowest depths to which a seaman
could come down.</p>

<p>When four days out from the curiously named
islands, a cry went up from the watch,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sail ho! Off the port bow! A British frigate, by
much that&rsquo;s good, and she&rsquo;s after us with all speed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which bold Lafitte answered, &ldquo;Then, we must
run for it!&rdquo; But he hoisted every bit of canvas which
he had about and headed for the Bay of Bengal.
&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if she does not catch us and we get
away, we&rsquo;ll take an English merchantman and burn
her.&rdquo; Then he laughed satirically.</p>

<p>The British frigate plodded along after the lighter
vessel of Lafitte&rsquo;s until the Equator was reached, and
then she disappeared,&mdash;disgruntled at not being able
to catch the saucy tartar. But the privateersman
headed for the blue Bay of Bengal; there fell in with
an English armed schooner with a numerous crew;
and&mdash;although he only had two guns and twenty-six
men aboard his own vessel&mdash;he tackled the sailors
from the chilly isle like a terrier shaking a rat. There
was a stiff little fight upon the shimmering waves of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg&nbsp;346]</a></span>
the Indian Ocean. When night descended the Britisher
had struck and nineteen blood-stained ruffians
from the privateer took possession of the battered hulk,
singing a song which ran:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;For it&rsquo;s fourteen men on a dead man&rsquo;s chest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yo-Ho-Ho and a bottle of rum.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lafitte was now feeling better; his men had been
fed; he had good plunder; and he possessed two
staunch, little craft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s bear away for India, my Hearties,&rdquo; cried he,
&ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll hit another Englishman and take her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What he had said soon came to pass, for, when off
the hazy, low-lying coast of Bengal, a rakish East
Indiaman came lolling by, armed with twenty-six
twelve-pounders and manned with one hundred and
fifty men. A bright boarding upon her stern-posts
flaunted the truly Eastern name: the <i>Pagoda</i>.</p>

<p>The dull-witted Britishers had no suspicions of the
weak, Puritan-looking, little two-&rsquo;undred tonner of
Lafitte&rsquo;s, as she glided in close; luffed; and bobbed
about, as a voice came:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sa-a-y! Want a pilot fer the Ganges?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no reply for a while. Then a voice
shrilled back,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come up on th&rsquo; port quarter. That&rsquo;s just what
we&rsquo;ve been lookin&rsquo; for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fat <i>Pagoda</i> ploughed listlessly onward, as the
unsuspicious-looking pilot plodded up on the port side;
in fact, most of the crew were dozing comfortably
under awnings on the deck, when a shot rang out.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg&nbsp;347]</a></span>
Another and another followed, and, with a wild, ear-splitting
whoop, the followers of Lafitte clambered
across the rail; dirks in their mouths; pistols in their
right hands, and cutlasses in their left.</p>

<p>Now was a short and bloodless fight. Taken completely
by surprise, the Englishmen threw up their
hands and gave in only too willingly. With smiles of
satisfaction upon their faces, the seamen of the bad
man from St. Malo soon hauled two kegs of spirits
upon the decks, and held high revel upon the clean
boarding of the rich and valuable prize. The <i>Pagoda</i>
was re-christened <i>The Pride of St. Malo</i>, and soon
went off privateering upon her own hook; while Lafitte
headed back for St. Thomas: well-fed&mdash;even
sleek with good living&mdash;and loaded down with the
treasure which he had taken. &ldquo;Ah-ha!&rdquo; cried the
black-haired navigator. &ldquo;I am going to be King of
the Indian waters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now came the most bloody and successful of his
battles upon the broad highway of the gleaming,
southern ocean.</p>

<p>Taking command of the <i>La Confidence</i> of twenty-six
guns and two hundred and fifty men, whom he found
at the port of St. Thomas, he again headed for the
coast of British India; keen in the expectation of
striking a valuable prize. And his expectations were
well fulfilled.</p>

<p>In October, 1807, the welcome cry of &ldquo;Sail Ho!&rdquo;
sounded from the forward watch, when off the Sand
Heads, and there upon the starboard bow was a spot
of white, which proved to be a Queen&rsquo;s East Indiaman,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg&nbsp;348]</a></span>
with a crew of near four hundred. She carried
forty guns.</p>

<p>There were double the number of cannon, there
were double the number of men, but Lafitte cried out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came out to fight and I&rsquo;m going to do it, comrades!
You see before you a vessel which is stronger
than our own, but, with courage and nerve, we can
beat her. I will run our own ship close to the enemy.
You must lie down behind the protecting sides of our
vessel until we touch the stranger. Then&mdash;when I
give the signal to board&mdash;let each man seize a cutlass,
a dirk, and two pistols, and strike down all that
oppose him. We <em>must</em> and <em>can</em> win!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These stirring words were greeted by a wild and
hilarious cheer.</p>

<p>Now, running upon the port tack, the <i>La Confidence</i>
bore down upon the Britisher with the water boiling
under her bows; while the stranger luffed, and prepared
for action. Shrill cries sounded from her huge
carcass as her guns were loaded and trained upon the
on-coming foe, while her masts began to swarm with
sharpshooters eager to pick off the ravenous sea-dogs
from the Mauritius.</p>

<p>Suddenly a terrific roar sounded above the rattle
of ropes and creak of hawsers&mdash;and a broadside cut
into the <i>La Confidence</i> with keen accuracy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lie flat upon the deck,&rdquo; cried Lafitte, &ldquo;and dodge
the iron boys if you can see &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His men obeyed, and, as the missiles pounded into
the broad sides of their ship, the steersman ran her
afoul of the Queen&rsquo;s East Indiaman. When he did
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg&nbsp;349]</a></span>
so, many sailors swarmed into the rigging, and from
the yards and tops threw bombs and grenades into the
forecastle of the enemy, so that death and terror made
the Britishers abandon the portion of their vessel near
the mizzen-mast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forty of the crew will now board,&rdquo; cried Lafitte.
&ldquo;And let every mother&rsquo;s son strike home!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With pistols in their hands and daggers held between
their teeth, the wild sea-rovers rollicked across
the gunwales like a swarm of rats. Dancing up the
deck of the Britisher they beat back all who opposed
them, driving them below into the steerage. Shots
rang out like spitting cats; dirks gleamed; and cutlasses
did awful execution. But the Captain of the
Indiaman was rallying his men about him on the poop,
and, with a wild cheer, these precipitated themselves
upon the victorious privateers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Board! Board!&rdquo; cried Lafitte, at this propitious
moment, and, cutlass in hand, he leaped from his own
vessel upon the deck of the East Indiaman. His crew
followed with a yelp of defiant hatred, and beat the
Captain&rsquo;s party back again upon the poop, where they
stood stolidly, cursing at the rough sea-riders from
St. Thomas.</p>

<p>But Lafitte was a general not to be outdone by such
a show of force. He ordered a gun to be loaded with
grape-shot; had it pointed towards the place where
the crowd was assembled; and cried&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t give in now, I&rsquo;ll exterminate all of
you at one discharge of my piece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the last blow. Seeing that it was useless to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg&nbsp;350]</a></span>
continue the unequal struggle, the British Captain
held up his long cutlass, to which was bound a white
handkerchief, and the great sea battle was over. Lafitte
and his terrible crew had captured a boat of double
the size of his own, and with twice his numbers.</p>

<p>Says an old chronicler of the period: &ldquo;This exploit,
hitherto unparalleled, resounded through India, and
the name of Lafitte became the terror of English commerce
in these latitudes. The British vessels now
traversed the Indian Ocean under strong convoys, in
order to beat off this harpy of South Africa.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Egad,&rdquo; said Lafitte about this time, &ldquo;these fellows
are too smart for me. I&rsquo;ll have to look for other
pickings. I&rsquo;m off for France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he doubled the Cape of Good Hope, coasted up
the Gulf of Guinea, and, in the Bight of Benin, took
two valuable prizes loaded down with gold dust, ivory,
and palm oil. With these he ran to St. Malo, where
the people said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tenez! Here is a brave fellow, but would you
care to have his reputation, Monsieur?&rdquo; And they
shook their heads, shrugged their shoulders, and
looked the other way when they saw him coming.</p>

<p>The privateersman, slaver, and pirate was not going
to be long with them, however, for he soon fitted out
a brigantine, mounted twenty guns on her, and with
one hundred and fifty men, sailed for Guadaloupe,
among the West Indies. He took several valuable
prizes, but, during his absence upon a cruise, the island
was captured by the British, so he started for a more
congenial clime. He roved about for some months,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg&nbsp;351]</a></span>
to settle at last at Barrataria, near New Orleans,
Louisiana. He was rich; he had amassed great quantities
of booty; and he was a man of property. Lafitte,
in fact, was a potentate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the privateer and pirate, &ldquo;I will settle
down and found a colony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But can a man of action keep still?</p>

<p>It is true that Lafitte was not as bold and audacious
as before, for he was now obliged to have dealings
with merchants of the United States and the West
Indies who frequently owed him large sums of money,
and the cautious transactions necessary to found and
to conduct a colony of pirates and smugglers in the
very teeth of civilization, made the black-haired
Frenchman cloak his real character under a veneer of
supposed gentility. Hundreds of privateers, pirates,
and smugglers gathered around the banner of this
robber of the high seas.</p>

<p>But what is Barrataria?</p>

<p>Part of the coast of Louisiana is called by that
name: that part lying between Bastien Bay on the
east, and the mouth of the wide river, or bayou of
La Fourche, on the west. Not far from the rolling,
sun-baked Atlantic are the lakes of Barrataria, connecting
with one another by several large bayous and a
great number of branches. In one of these is the
Island of Barrataria, while this sweet-sounding name
is also given to a large basin which extends the entire
length of the cypress swamps, from the Gulf of
Mexico, to a point three miles above New Orleans.
The waters from this lake slowly empty into the Gulf
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg&nbsp;352]</a></span>
by two passages through the Bayou Barrataria, between
which lies an island called Grand Terre: six
miles in length, and three in breadth, running parallel
with the coast. To the West of this is the great pass
of Barrataria, where is about nine to ten feet of water:
enough to float the ordinary pirate or privateersman&rsquo;s
vessel. Within this pass&mdash;about two miles from the
open sea&mdash;lies the only safe harbor upon the coast,
and this is where the cut-throats, pirates, and smugglers
gathered under Lafitte. They called themselves
<i>Barratarians</i>, and they were a godless crew.</p>

<p>At a place called Grand Terre, the privateers would
often make public sale of their cargoes and prizes by
auction. And the most respectable inhabitants of the
State were accustomed to journey there in order to
purchase the goods which the <i>Barratarians</i> had to
offer. They would smile, and say,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going to get some of the treasure of
Captain Kidd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Government of the United States did not
take so kindly to the idea of a privateer and pirate
colony within its borders. And&mdash;with malice aforethought&mdash;one
Commodore Patterson was sent to disperse
these marauders at Barrataria, who, confident
of their strength and fighting ability, defiantly flaunted
their flag in the faces of the officers of the Government.
&ldquo;We can lick the whole earth,&rdquo; chuckled the
piratical followers of Lafitte.</p>

<p>Patterson was a good fighter. On June the eleventh
he departed from New Orleans with seventy members
of the 44th regiment of infantry. On the sixteenth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg&nbsp;353]</a></span>
he made for the Island of Barrataria, with some six
gun-boats, a launch mounting one twelve pound carronade;
the <i>Sea Horse</i> (a tender carrying one six-pounder)
and the schooner <i>Carolina</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must fight, Boys,&rdquo; cried Lafitte to his ill-assorted
mates. &ldquo;Come, take to our schooners and
show these officers that the followers of Lafitte can
battle like Trojans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cheer greeted these noble sentiments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lead on!&rdquo; yelled his cut-throats. &ldquo;Lead on and
we&rsquo;ll sink these cocky soldiers as we&rsquo;ve done to many
an East Indiaman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, about two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, the privateers
and pirates formed their vessels, ten in number
(including their prizes) near the entrance of the
harbor.</p>

<p><em>Crash!</em></p>

<p>A shell from the forward gun of the leading gun-boat
spun across the bows of Lafitte&rsquo;s flagship and
buried itself in the gray water with a dull sob.</p>

<p>Up went a huge white flag upon the foremost mast-head
of the king pirate and these words could be
plainly seen:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon for all Deserters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, ha,&rdquo; chuckled Patterson. &ldquo;The arch ruffian
has heard that some of my men are ashore and this
is the way he would hire them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Crash!</em></p>

<p>Another shell ricochetted across the still surface
of the harbor and sunk itself in the side of a piratical
brig.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg&nbsp;354]</a></span>
&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; cried a Lieutenant, running up to the
United States Commander. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re giving up already.
See! The beggars are hastening ashore in
order to skip into the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so,&rdquo; answered the disappointed Commodore.
&ldquo;All my pains for nothing. The fellows
are getting away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough&mdash;afraid to remain and fight it out&mdash;the
craven followers of Lafitte now turned their
schooners to the shore&mdash;ran their bows into the sand,
and, leaping overboard, made into the forest as fast
as their legs could carry them. Thus&mdash;without firing
a shot&mdash;the cowardly pirates of Barrataria &ldquo;took to
the bush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The enemy had mounted on their vessels, twenty
pieces of cannon of different calibre,&rdquo; wrote Patterson,
after this tame affair. &ldquo;And, as I have since learnt,
they had from eight hundred to one thousand men of
all nations and colors. When I perceived the pirates
forming their vessels into a line of battle I felt confident,
from their fleet and very advantageous position,
and their number of men, that they would have fought
me. Their not doing so I regret; for had they, I
should have been enabled more effectually to destroy
or make prisoners of them and their leaders; but it
is a subject of great satisfaction to me, to have effected
the object of my enterprise, without the loss of a man.
On the afternoon of the 23rd, I got under way with
my whole squadron, in all seventeen vessels, but during
the night one escaped and the next day I arrived
at New Orleans with my entire command.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg&nbsp;355]</a></span>
Thus ended the magnificent (?) attempt of the
vainglorious Lafitte to stem the advance of the Government
of the United States. In the parlance of the
camp, &ldquo;He was a fust-class quitter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he did not show himself to be a &ldquo;quitter&rdquo; in
the battle of New Orleans.</p>

<p>The English and Americans, in fact, were soon at
each other&rsquo;s throats in the ungentle game of war. At
different times the British had sought to attack the
pirates of Barrataria, in the hope of taking their
prizes and armed vessels. On June 23rd, 1813, while
two of Lafitte&rsquo;s privateers were lying to off of Cat
Island, an English sloop-of-war came to anchor at
the entrance of the pass, and sent out two boats in the
endeavor to capture the rakish sea-robbers. But they
were repulsed with severe and galling loss.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of September, 1814, an armed brig
appeared on the coast, opposite the famous pass to the
home of the rangers of the sea. She fired a gun at a
smuggler, about to enter, and forced her to poke her
nose into a sand-bar; she then jibed over and came
to anchor at the entrance to the shallows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That vessel means business, sure,&rdquo; said one of the
pirates to Lafitte. &ldquo;She has spouted one gun, but now
she&rsquo;s lyin&rsquo; to. Better see what&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; answered the famous sea-rover.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go off in a boat and look out for what&rsquo;s going
to happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, starting from the shore, he was soon on his way
to the brig, from which a pinnace was lowered, in
which could be seen two officers, one of whom had a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg&nbsp;356]</a></span>
flag of truce. The two boats rapidly neared each
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Mr. Lafitte?&rdquo; cried one of the Britishers,
as the pinnace neared the shore. &ldquo;I would speak with
the Laird of Barrataria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Lafitte was not anxious to make himself known.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s ashore,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But, if you have communications
for him, these I can deliver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray, give him these packages, my good man,&rdquo;
spoke the English tar, handing him a bundle of letters,
tied up in tarpaulin.</p>

<p>Lafitte smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would be delighted to do so,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But,
pray come ashore and there I will return you your answer
after I have seen the great Captain, who is camping
about a league inland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Britishers readily assented, and both rowed
towards the sandy beach, where a great number of
pirates of Barrataria had collected.</p>

<p>As soon as the boats were in shallow water, Lafitte
made himself known to the English, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not let my men know upon what business you
come, for it will go ill with you. My followers know
that war is now on between Great Britain and
the United States, and, if they hear you are
making overtures with me, they will wish to hang
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was as he had said. When the Englishmen
landed, a great cry went up amongst the privateers,
pirates and smugglers:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang the spies! Kill the dirty dogs! To the yard-arm
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg&nbsp;357]</a></span>
with the rascally Englishmen! Send the hounds
to New Orleans and to jail!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Lafitte dissuaded the multitude from their intent
and led the officers in safety to his dwelling, where he
opened the package, finding a proclamation addressed
to the inhabitants of Louisiana, by Col. Edward
Nichalls&mdash;British commander of the land forces in
this state&mdash;requesting them to come under the sheltering
arm of the British Government. There were also
two letters to himself, asking him to join and fight
with the English.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will but battle with us,&rdquo; said Captain
Lockyer&mdash;one of the British officers&mdash;&ldquo;we will
give you command of a forty-four gun frigate, and
will make you a Post Captain. You will also receive
thirty thousand dollars,&mdash;payable at Pensacola.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lafitte looked dubiously at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give answer in a few days,&rdquo; he replied, with
courtesy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a Frenchman,&rdquo; continued the British Captain.
&ldquo;You are not in the service of the United States,
nor likely to be. Come&mdash;man&mdash;give us a reply at
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Lafitte was obdurate, for&mdash;strange as it
may seem&mdash;he wished to inform the officers of the
State Government of this project of the English. So
he withdrew to his own hut.</p>

<p>As he did this, the pirates seized the British officers,
dragged them to a cabin, and thrust them inside. A
guard was stationed at the door, while cries went up
from every quarter:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg&nbsp;358]</a></span>
&ldquo;To New Orleans with the scoundrels! A yard-arm
for the butchers! A rope&rsquo;s end for the scurvy
tars!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lafitte was furious when he learned of this, and,
after haranguing the crowd, had the Britishers released.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you treat men under a flag of truce as prisoners,&rdquo;
he cried, &ldquo;you break one of the first rules of
warfare. You will get the same treatment if you,
yourselves, are captured, and you will lose the opportunity
of discovering what are the projects of the
British upon Louisiana.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His men saw the good sense of these words of
advice, and acted accordingly.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the officers were escorted
to their pinnace with many apologies from Lafitte, who
now wrote a letter to Captain Lockyer, which shows
him to have been a man of considerable cultivation,
and not a mere &ldquo;rough and tumble&rdquo; pirate&mdash;without
education or refinement. He said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="address">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Barrataria</span>, 4th Sept., 1814.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To Captain Lockyer,</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;The confusion which prevailed in our
camp yesterday and this morning, and of which you
have a complete knowledge, has prevented me from
answering in a precise manner to the object of your
mission; nor even at this moment can I give you all
the satisfaction that you desire. However, if you could
grant me a fortnight, I would be entirely at your disposal
at the end of that time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg&nbsp;359]</a></span>
&ldquo;This delay is indispensable to enable me to put my
affairs in order. You may communicate with me by
sending a boat to the Eastern point of the pass, where
I will be found. You have inspired me with more confidence
than the Admiral&mdash;your superior officer&mdash;could
have done, himself. With you alone I wish to
deal, and from you, also, I will claim in due time, the
reward of the services which I may render you.</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;Your very respectful servant,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">J. Lafitte.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>His object in writing this letter&mdash;you see&mdash;was,
by appearing to accede to the proposals, to give time to
communicate the affair to the officers of the State Government
of Louisiana and to receive from them instructions
how to act, under circumstances so critical
and important to his own country: that is, the country
of his adoption.</p>

<p>He, therefore, addressed the following epistle to the
Governor of Louisiana. Do you think that you, yourself,
could write as well as did this pirate?</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="address">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Barrataria</span>, Sept. 4th, 1814.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To Governor Claiborne:</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;In the firm persuasion that the choice made
of you to fill the office of first magistrate of this State,
was dictated by the esteem of your fellow citizens, and
was conferred on merit, I confidently address you on an
affair on which may depend the safety of this country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I offer to you to restore to this State several citizens,
who perhaps, in your eyes, have lost that sacred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg&nbsp;360]</a></span>
title. I offer you them, however, such as you could
wish to find them, ready to exert their utmost efforts
in the defence of the country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This point of Louisiana, which I occupy, is of great
importance in the present crisis. I tender my services
to defend it; and the only reward I ask is that a stop
be put to the proscription against me and my adherents,
by an act of oblivion, for all that has been done heretofore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the stray sheep wishing to return to the fold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are thoroughly acquainted with the nature
of my offences, I should appear to you much less guilty,
and still worthy to discharge the duties of a good citizen.
I have never sailed under any flag but the republic
of Carthagena, and my vessels were perfectly regular
in that respect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could have brought my lawful prizes into the
ports of this State, I should not have employed illicit
means that have caused me to be proscribed (hounded
by the State authorities).</p>

<p>&ldquo;I decline to say more upon this subject until I have
your Excellency&rsquo;s answer, which I am persuaded can
be dictated only by wisdom. Should your answer not
be favorable to my ardent desire, I declare to you that
I will instantly leave the country, to avoid the imputation
of having co&ouml;perated towards an invasion on this
point, which cannot fail to take place, and to rest secure
in the acquittal of my conscience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the honor to be,</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;Your Excellency&rsquo;s Most Humble Servant,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">J. Lafitte.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg&nbsp;361]</a></span>
Now how is that for a swashbuckling privateer?
Anyone would be proud of such a letter and it does
honor to the judgment of this sand-spit king, giving
clear evidence of a strange but sincere attachment to
the American cause. Hurrah for the Frenchman!</p>

<p>This missive, in fact, made such an impression upon
the Governor that he had an interview with Lafitte,
who was ushered into his presence only to find General
Andrew Jackson (Old Hickory) closeted with the chief
executive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said the effusive Governor. &ldquo;Your
praiseworthy wishes shall be laid before the council of
the State, and I will confer with my august friend, here
present, upon this important affair, and send you an
answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bowing low, the courteous privateersman withdrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; cried Old Hickory after his retreating
form. &ldquo;When we meet again I trust that it will be
in the ranks of the American Army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in two days&rsquo; time appeared the following proclamation:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Governor of Louisiana, informed that many
individuals implicated in the offences hitherto committed
against the United States at Barrataria, express
a willingness at the present crisis to enroll themselves
and march against the enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He does hereby invite them to join the standard
of the United States, and is authorized to say, should
their conduct in the field meet the approbation of the
Major General, that that officer will unite with the
Governor in a request to the President of the United
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg&nbsp;362]</a></span>
States, to extend to each and every individual, so
marching and acting, a free and full pardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Lafitte saw these words, he fairly yelled with
delight, and it is said that he jumped into the air,
cracking his heels three times together before he struck
the ground.</p>

<p>The orders were circulated among his followers and
most of them readily embraced the pardon which they
held out. Thus&mdash;in a few days&mdash;many brave men
and skillful artillerists flocked to the red-white-and-blue
standard of the United States. And when&mdash;a
few months afterwards&mdash;Old Hickory and his men
were crouched behind a line of cotton bales, awaiting
the attack of a British army (heroes, in fact, of Sargossa),
there, upon the left flank, was the sand-spit
King and his evil crew. Lafitte&rsquo;s eyes were sparkling
like an electric bulb, and the language of his followers
does not bear repetition.</p>

<p>It was the morning of January eighth. The British
were about to attack the American Army defending
New Orleans, which&mdash;under the leadership of stout
Andrew Jackson&mdash;now crouched behind the earthworks
and cotton bales, some miles from the city.
Rockets shot into the air with a sizzling snap. The
roar of cannon shook the thin palmettos, and wild
British cheers came from the lusty throats of the
British veterans of Spain, as they advanced to
the assault in close order&mdash;sixty men in front&mdash;with
fascines and ladders for scaling the defences.
Now a veritable storm of rockets hissed and sizzed
into the American lines, while a light battery of artillery
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg&nbsp;363]</a></span>
pom-pomed and growled upon the left flank. All
was silence in the dun-colored embankments.</p>

<p>But look! Suddenly a sheet of flame burst from
the earthworks where lay the buck-skin-clad rangers
from Tennessee and Kentucky: men who had fought
Indians; had cleared the forest for their rude log huts,
and were able to hit the eye of a squirrel at one hundred
yards. <em>Crash! Crash! Crash!</em> A flame of fire
burst through the pall of sulphurous smoke, a storm of
leaden missiles swept into the red coats of the advancing
British, and down they fell in windrows, like
wheat before the reaper. <em>Boom! Boom! Boom!</em> The
cannon growled and spat from the cotton bales, and
one of these&mdash;a twenty-four pounder&mdash;placed upon
the third embrasure from the river, from the fatal
skill and activity with which it was managed (even in
the best of battle),&mdash;drew the admiration of both
Americans and British. It became one of the points
most dreaded by the advancing foe. <em>Boom! Boom!</em>
It grumbled and roared its thunder, while Lafitte and
his corsairs of Barrataria rammed home the iron
charges, and&mdash;stripped to the waist&mdash;fought like
wolves at bay.</p>

<p>Two other batteries were manned by the Barratarians,
who served their pieces with the steadiness and
precision of veteran gunners. The enemy crept closer,
ever closer, and a column pushed forward between the
levee and the river so precipitously that the outposts
were forced to retire, closely pressed by the coats of
red. On, on, they came, and, clearing the ditch before
the earthworks, gained the redoubt through the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg&nbsp;364]</a></span>
embrasures, leaped over the parapet and quickly bayonetted
the small force of backwoodsmen who held
this point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the rescue, men,&rdquo; cried Lafitte, at this juncture.
&ldquo;Out and at &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cutlass in hand, the privateer called a few of his
best followers to his side; men who had often boarded
the decks of an East Indiaman and were well used to
hand-to-hand engagements. With a wild cheer they
leaped over the breastworks and rushed upon the
enemy.</p>

<p>The British were absolutely astonished at the intrepidity
of this advance. Pistols spat, cutlasses
swung, and one after another, the English officers fell
before the snapping blade of the King of Barrataria, as
they bravely cheered on their men. The practiced
boarders struck the red-coated columns with the same
fierceness with which they had often bounded upon the
deck of an enemy, and cheer after cheer welled above
the rattle of arms as the advancing guardsmen were
beaten back. All the energies of the British were concentrated
upon scaling the breastworks, which one
daring officer had already mounted. But Lafitte and
his followers, seconding a gallant band of volunteer
riflemen, formed a phalanx which it was impossible to
penetrate. They fought desperately.</p>

<p>It was now late in the day. The field was strewn
with the dead and dying. Still spat the unerring rifles
of the pioneers and still crashed the unswerving volleys
from their practiced rifles. &ldquo;We cannot take the
works,&rdquo; cried the British. &ldquo;We must give up.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg&nbsp;365]</a></span>
And&mdash;turning about&mdash;they beat a sad and solemn
retreat to their vessels. The great battle of New
Orleans was over, and Lafitte had done a Trojan&rsquo;s
share.</p>

<p>In a few days peace was declared between the United
States and Great Britain, and General Jackson&mdash;in
his correspondence with the Secretary of War&mdash;did
not fail to speak in the most flattering terms of the
conduct of the &ldquo;Corsairs of Barrataria.&rdquo; They had
fought like tigers, and they had been sadly misjudged
by the English, who wished to enlist them in their own
cause. Their zeal, their courage, and their skill, were
noticed by the whole American Army, who could no
longer stigmatize such desperate fighters as &ldquo;criminals.&rdquo;
Many had been sabred and wounded in defence
of New Orleans, and many had given up their lives
before the sluggish bayous of the Mississippi. And
now, Mr. Lafitte, it is high time that you led a decent
life, for are you not a hero?</p>

<p>But &ldquo;murder will out,&rdquo; and once a privateer always
a privateer, and sometimes a pirate.</p>

<p>Securing some fast sailing vessels, the King of
Barrataria sailed to Galveston Bay, in 1819, where he
received a commission from General Long as a &ldquo;privateer.&rdquo;
Not content with living an honest and peaceful
life, he proceeded to do a little smuggling and
illicit trading upon his own account, so it was not long
before a United States cruiser was at anchor off the
port to watch his movements. He was now Governor
of Galveston, and considered himself to be a personage
of great moment. Five vessels were generally cruising
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg&nbsp;366]</a></span>
under his orders, while three hundred men obeyed his
word. Texas was then a Republic.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Sir&rdquo;&mdash;wrote Lafitte to the Commander of the
American cruiser off the port of Galveston&mdash;&ldquo;I am
convinced that you are a cruiser of the navy, ordered
here by your Government. I have, therefore, deemed
it proper to inquire into the cause of your lying before
this port without communicating your intention. I
wish to inform you that the port of Galveston belongs
to and is in the possession of the Republic of Texas,
and was made a port of entry the 9th day of October,
last. And, whereas the Supreme Congress of the said
Republic have thought proper to appoint me as Governor
of this place, in consequence of which, if you
have any demands on said Government, you will please
to send an officer with such demands, who will be
treated with the greatest politeness. But, if you are
ordered, or should attempt, to enter this port in a hostile
manner, my oath and duty to the Government compel
me to rebut your intentions at the expense of my
life.</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;Yours very respectfully,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">J. Lafitte.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>But to this the American officer paid no attention.
Instead, he attacked a band of Lafitte&rsquo;s followers, who
had stationed themselves on an island near Barrataria
with several cannon, swearing that they would perish
rather than surrender to any man. As they had
committed piracy, they were open to assault.
Twenty were taken, tried at New Orleans, and hung,&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg&nbsp;367]</a></span>
rest escaped into the cypress swamps, where it
was impossible to arrest them.</p>

<p>When Lafitte heard of this, he said with much feeling:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A war of extermination is to be waged against me.
I, who have fought and bled for the United States.
I who helped them to win the battle of New Orleans.
My cruisers are to be swept from the sea. I must turn
from Governor of Galveston, and privateer to pirate.
Then&mdash;away&mdash;and let them catch me if they can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now comes the last phase of his career. Too bad
that he could not have died honestly!</p>

<p>Procuring a large and fast-sailing brigantine, mounting
sixteen guns, and having selected a crew of one
hundred and sixty men, the desperate and dangerous
Governor of Galveston set sail upon the sparkling
waters of the Gulf, determined to rob all nations and
neither to give quarter nor to receive it.</p>

<p>But luck was against him. A British sloop-of-war
was cruising in the Mexican Gulf, and, hearing that
Lafitte, himself, was at sea, kept a sharp lookout at
the mast-head for the sails of the pirate.</p>

<p>One morning as an officer was sweeping the horizon
with his glass he discovered a long, dark-looking vessel,
low in the water: her sails as white as snow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sail off the port bow,&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Pirate,
or else I&rsquo;m a landlubber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the sloop-of-war could out-sail the corsair, before
the wind, she set her studding-sails and crowded every
inch of canvas in chase. Lafitte soon ascertained the
character of his pursuer, and, ordering the awnings to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg&nbsp;368]</a></span>
be furled, set his big square-sail and shot rapidly
through the water. But the breeze freshened and the
sloop-of-war rapidly overhauled the scudding brigantine.
In an hour&rsquo;s time she was within hailing distance
and Lafitte was in a fight for his very life.</p>

<p><em>Crash!</em></p>

<p>A cannon belched from the stern of the pirate and a
ball came dangerously near the bowsprit of the Englishman.</p>

<p><em>Crash! Crash!</em></p>

<p>Other guns roared out their challenge and the iron
fairly hailed upon the decks of the sloop-of-war; killing
and wounding many of the crew. But&mdash;silently
and surely&mdash;she kept on until within twenty yards
of the racing outlaw.</p>

<p>Now was a deafening roar. A broadside howled
above the dancing spray&mdash;it rumbled from the port-holes
of the Englishman&mdash;cutting the foremast of
the pirate in two; severing the jaws of the main-gaff;
and sending great clods of rigging to the deck. Ten
followers of Lafitte fell prostrate, but the great Frenchman
was uninjured.</p>

<p>A crash, a rattle, a rush, and the Englishman ran
afoul of the foe&mdash;while&mdash;with a wild cheer, her
sailors clambered across the starboard rails; cutlasses
in the right hand, pistols in the left, dirks between
their teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never give in, men!&rdquo; cried the King of Barrataria.
&ldquo;You are now with Lafitte, who, as you have
learned, does not know how to surrender.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Britishers were in far superior numbers.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg&nbsp;369]</a></span>
Backwards&mdash;ever backwards&mdash;they drove the desperate
crew of the pirate ship. Two pistol balls struck
Lafitte in the side which knocked him to the planking;
a grape-shot broke the bone of his right leg; he
was desperate, dying, and fighting like a tiger. He
groaned in the agony of despair.</p>

<p>The deck was slippery with blood as the Captain of
the boarders rushed upon the prostrate corsair to put
him forever out of his way. While he aimed a blow
a musket struck him in the temple, stretching him
beside the bleeding Lafitte, who, raising himself upon
one elbow, thrust a dagger at the throat of his assailant.</p>

<p>But the tide of his existence was ebbing like a torrent;
his brain was giddy; his aim faltered; the point
of the weapon descended upon the right thigh of the
bleeding Englishman. Again the reeking steel was
upheld; again the weakened French sea-dog plunged
a stroke at this half-fainting assailant.</p>

<p>The dizziness of death spread over the sight of the
Monarch of the Gulf of Mexico. Down came the
dagger into the left thigh of the Captain; listlessly;
helplessly; aimlessly; and Lafitte&mdash;the robber of St.
Malo&mdash;fell lifeless upon the rocking deck. His spirit
went out amidst the hoarse and hollow cheers of the
victorious Jack-tars of the clinging sloop-of-war.</p>

<p class="author">&mdash;<i>Song of the Chief Mate of the Alabama.</i>&mdash;1864.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was off the east coast of South America. The
year was 1864, and a little schooner&mdash;the <i>Justina</i>&mdash;bobbed
along, with the flag of the United
States Government flying jauntily from her gaff.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a movement on deck. Men
rushed hither and thither with some show of excitement.
Glasses were brought out and raised,&mdash;smothered
cries of excitement were mingled with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg&nbsp;376]</a></span>
orders to trim sails. All eyes looked with suspicion and
dismay at a long, graceful vessel which was seen
approaching from the northward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Alabama</i>!&rdquo; cried one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the cursed <i>Alabama</i>!&rdquo; answered another.
&ldquo;We are lost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>On, on came the pursuing vessel; a cloud of black
smoke rolling from her smoke-stack; her white sails
bellying in the fresh breeze; for she was rigged like
a barquentine, with a lean body, single smoke-stack,
and a polished rifle-gun winking in the sun-rays upon
her bow. On, on, she came, and then&mdash;<em>puff! boom!</em>&mdash;a
single shot came dancing in front of the slow-moving
schooner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pull down the colors!&rdquo; shouted the Captain of
the <i>Justina</i>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re done for!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down came the ensign of the United States, and
the little schooner was luffed so that she stood still.
The <i>Alabama</i> ranged up alongside, a boat soon
brought a crew of boarders, and, before many moments,
she was in the hands of Captain Raphael
Semmes and his men.</p>

<p>That evening the <i>Alabama</i> steamed southward, the
crew of the <i>Justina</i> was on board, her rich cargo filled
the hold, and a black curl of smoke and hissing flames
marked where the proud, little merchantman had once
bobbed upon the rolling water. Raphael Semmes was
happy, for his work of destroying the commerce of the
United States Navy had progressed far better than he
had hoped.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">RAPHAEL SEMMES.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Men!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;The cause of the Confederate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg&nbsp;377]</a></span>
States of America was never brighter upon the ocean
than now. Give three times three for Jeff. Davis&mdash;his
soldiers and his sailors!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A rousing cheer rose above the waves, and the
proud privateer bounded onward upon her career of
destruction and death. The <i>Alabama</i> was in the zenith
of her power.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The scene now shifts to the harbor of Cherbourg,
upon the western coast of France. The <i>Alabama</i> lay
there,&mdash;safely swinging at her anchor-chains within
the break-water. She had come in to refit, for her
bottom was much befouled by a long cruise, which
had been successful. Built at Birkenhead, England,
for the Confederate States Government, she set sail
in August, 1862; and had been down the coast of
North and South America; around the Cape of Good
Hope to India, and back to the shores of France.
Sixty-six vessels had fallen into her clutches, and of
these fifty-two had been burned; ten had been released
on bond; one had been sold, and one set free.
Truly she had had a marvellous trip.</p>

<p>As she slumbered on&mdash;like a huge sea-turtle&mdash;a
black cloud of smoke appeared above the break-water,
and a low-bodied United States cruiser slowly steamed
into the harbor. She nosed about, as if looking for
safe anchorage, and kept upon the opposite side of
the little bay.</p>

<p>Immediately all hands clambered to the side of the
Confederate cruiser, and glasses were levelled at this
vessel which carried the flag of opposition.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg&nbsp;378]</a></span>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s stronger than we are,&rdquo; said one of the crew.</p>

<p>Another grinned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at her eleven-pounders,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I see
her name, now. She&rsquo;s the <i>Kearsarge</i>, and about our
tonnage, but I reckon that she carries more men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Semmes, himself, had come up from below,
and was examining the intruder with his glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to fight that ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, as he withdrew into the cabin, all seemed to
be well pleased with this announcement.</p>

<p>The <i>Kearsarge</i>, commanded by Captain John A.
Winslow, had been lying at anchor in the Scheldt, off
Flushing, Holland, when a gun roared from the forward
part of the ship, warning those officers who had
gone ashore, to come on board. Steam was raised,
and, as soon as all were collected on deck, the Captain
read a telegram from Mr. Dayton, the Minister to
France from the United States. It said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Alabama</i> has arrived at Cherbourg. Come
at once or she will escape you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe that we&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to fight
her,&rdquo; said Captain Winslow. &ldquo;So be prepared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this, all of his sailors cheered wildly.</p>

<p>The <i>Kearsarge</i> was a staunch craft; she was two
hundred and thirty-two feet over all, with thirty-three
feet of beam, and carried seven guns; two
eleven inch pivots, smooth bore; one thirty-pound rifle,
and four light thirty-two pounders. Her crew numbered
one hundred and sixty-three men. The sleeping
<i>Alabama</i> had but one hundred and forty-nine souls
on board, and eight guns: one sixty-eight pounder
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg&nbsp;379]</a></span>
pivot rifle, smooth bore; one one hundred-pounder
pivot, and six heavy thirty-two pounders. So, you
see, that the two antagonists were evenly matched,
with the superior advantage of the numbers of men on
the <i>Kearsarge</i> offset by the extra guns of her opponent.</p>

<p>Most of the officers upon the <i>Kearsarge</i> were from
the merchant service, and, of the crew, only eleven
were of foreign birth. Most of the officers upon the
<i>Alabama</i> had served in the navy of the United States;
while nearly all of her crew were either English,
Irish, or Welsh. A few of the gunners had been
trained aboard the <i>Excellent</i>: a British training ship
in Portsmouth Harbor. Her Captain&mdash;Raphael
Semmes&mdash;was once an officer in the navy of the
United States. He had served in the Mexican War,
but had joined the Southern cause, as he was a
Marylander. He was an able navigator and seaman.</p>

<p>The <i>Kearsarge</i> cruised about the port of Cherbourg,
poked her bows nearly into the break-water,
and then withdrew. The French neutrality law would
only allow a foreign vessel to remain in a harbor for
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will she come out?&rdquo; was the question now upon
every lip aboard the <i>Kearsarge</i>. &ldquo;Will she come out
and fight? Oh, just for one crack at this destroyer
of our commerce!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she did not come out, and the <i>Kearsarge</i> beat
around the English Channel in anxious suspense.</p>

<p>Several days later Captain Winslow went ashore
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg&nbsp;380]</a></span>
and paid a visit to the United States Commercial
Agent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That beastly pirate will not fight,&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;All she wants to do is to run away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Imagine how his eyes shone when he was handed
the following epistle!</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="address">&ldquo;C.S.S. <i>Alabama</i>, <span class="smcap">Cherbourg</span>, June 14th, 1864.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To <span class="smcap">A. Bonfils</span>, Esqr., Cherbourg;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;I hear that you were informed by the
United States Consul that the <i>Kearsarge</i> was to come
to this port solely for the prisoners landed by me, and
that she was to depart in twenty-four hours. I desire
you to say to the U.&nbsp;S. Consul that my intention is
to fight the <i>Kearsarge</i> as soon as I can make the
necessary arrangements. I hope these will not detain
me more than until to-morrow evening, or after the
morrow morning at furthest. I beg she will not depart
before I am ready to go out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the honor to be, very respectfully,</p>

<p class="sig">&ldquo;Your obedient servant,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">R. Semmes</span>, Captain.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! Ha!&rdquo; chuckled Winslow. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in for it,
now. Hurray!&rdquo; and he hastened back to his ship to
spread the glad tidings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My boys!&rdquo; said he to his crew. &ldquo;It is probable
that the two ships will engage on parallel lines, and,
if defeated, the <i>Alabama</i> will seek for neutral waters.
It is necessary, therefore, that we begin this action
several miles from the break-water. The <i>Alabama</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg&nbsp;381]</a></span>
must believe that she can win, or she would not fight
us, for, if we sink her, she cannot be replaced by the
Confederate Government. As for ourselves, let us
never give up, and&mdash;if we sink&mdash;let us go down with
the flag flying!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear! Hear!&rdquo; cried all. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re with you,
Captain. Never give up the ship!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clean decks, boys!&rdquo; continued brave Winslow.
&ldquo;Get everything ship-shape for the coming affair, for
we&rsquo;re in for as tight a little fight as e&rsquo;er you entered
upon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Preparations were immediately made for battle, but
no <i>Alabama</i> appeared.</p>

<p>Thursday passed; Friday came; the <i>Kearsarge</i>
waited in the channel with ports down; guns pivoted
to starboard; the whole battery loaded; and shell,
grape, and canister ready to use in any method of
attack or defence,&mdash;but no <i>Alabama</i> appeared. A
French pilot-boat drifted near, and the black-eyed
skipper cried out,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You fellers look out for ze <i>Alabama</i>. She take
in much coal. Whew! She take much of ze captured
stuff ashore. Whew! She scrub ze deck. Whew!
She put ze sailors to ze business of sharpening ze cutlass
and ze dirk. Whew! You look out for ze great
privateer! Whew!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Winslow only smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zey have ze big feast,&rdquo; continued the Frenchman.
&ldquo;Zey dr-e-e-nk ze wine. Zey stan&rsquo; on ze chairs and
zey say, &lsquo;We will seenk ze Yankee dog.&rsquo; Ta donc!
Zey call you ze dog!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg&nbsp;382]</a></span>
And still Captain Winslow smiled. But, next day,
his smile turned to a frown.</p>

<p>It was Sunday, the nineteenth day of June. The
weather was beautiful; the atmosphere was somewhat
hazy; the wind was light; and there was little sea.
At ten o&rsquo;clock the <i>Kearsarge</i> was drifting near a buoy
about three miles eastward from the entrance of Cherbourg
break-water. Her decks had been newly holy-stoned;
the brass work had been cleaned; the guns
polished, and the crew had on their Sunday clothes.
They had been inspected, and dismissed&mdash;in order to
attend divine service.</p>

<p>At 1.20 a cry rang out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She comes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bell was tolling for prayers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Alabama</i>! The <i>Alabama</i>! She&rsquo;s moving,
and heading straight for us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All rushed to the deck; the drum beat to quarters.
Captain Winslow laid aside his prayer-book, seized
his trumpet, ordered the boat about, and headed seaward.
The ship was cleared for action and the battery
was pivoted to starboard.</p>

<p>Yes, she was coming!</p>

<p>From the western entrance of the safe, little French
seaport steamed the long-bodied, low-hulled privateer:
her rakish masts bending beneath the spread of
canvas: her tall funnel belching sepia smoke. A
French iron-clad frigate&mdash;the <i>Couronne</i>&mdash;accompanied
her, flying the pennant of the Commander-of-the-Port.
In her wake plodded a tiny fore-and-aft-rigged
steamer-yacht: the <i>Deerhound</i>, showing the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg&nbsp;383]</a></span>
flag of the Royal Mersey (British) Yacht Club. The
frigate&mdash;having convoyed the Confederate privateer
to the limit of the French waters (three marine miles
from the coast)&mdash;put down her helm and ploughed
back into port. The steam yacht continued on, and
remained near the scene of action.</p>

<p>As the <i>Alabama</i> had started upon her dash into the
open, Captain Semmes had mounted a gun-carriage,
and had cried,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Officers and Seamen of the <i>Alabama</i>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have at length another opportunity of meeting
the enemy&mdash;the first that has been presented to
you since you sank the <i>Hatteras</i>! In the meantime
you have been all over the world, and it is not too
much to say that you have destroyed, and driven for
protection under neutral flags, one-half of the enemy&rsquo;s
commerce, which, at the beginning of the war, covered
every sea. This is an achievement of which you
may well be proud, and a grateful country will not
be unmindful of it. The name of your ship has become
a household word wherever civilization extends!
Shall that name be tarnished by defeat? The thing
is impossible! Remember that you are in the English
Channel, the theatre of so much of the naval glory
of our race, and that the eyes of all Europe are, at
this moment, upon you. The flag that floats over
you is that of a young Republic, which bids defiance
to her enemies whenever and wherever found! Show
the world that you know how to uphold it! Go to
your quarters!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A wild yell had greeted these stirring expressions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg&nbsp;384]</a></span>
The shore was black with people, for the word had
been passed around that the two sea-warriors were to
grapple in deadly embrace. Even a special train had
come from Paris to bring the sober townsfolk to
Cherbourg, where they could view the contest. They
were chattering among themselves, like a flock of magpies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Voil&agrave;!&rdquo; said a fair damsel, whose eyes were fairly
shining with excitement. &ldquo;Oh, I hope zat ze beeg
gray fellow weel win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She meant the <i>Alabama</i>, for the Confederates
dressed in that sober color.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zis ees ze naval Waterloo!&rdquo; whispered a veteran
of the Crimean War.</p>

<p>It was 10.50 o&rsquo;clock. The <i>Kearsarge</i> had been
steaming out to sea, but now she wheeled. She was
seven miles from shore and one and one-quarter miles
from her opponent. She steered directly for her, as
if to ram her and crush through her side. The <i>Alabama</i>
sheered off and presented her starboard battery.
The <i>Kearsarge</i> came on, rapidly, and&mdash;at 10.57 was
about eighteen hundred yards from her enemy&mdash;then&mdash;<em>Crash!
Roar!</em> A broadside thundered from the
Confederate privateer, while the solid shot screamed
through the rigging of the Yankee man-of-war.</p>

<p>On! On! came Captain Winslow&rsquo;s gallant craft,
while a second and a third broadside crashed into her.
The rigging tore and swayed, but she was little injured.
She was now within nine hundred yards.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sheer! Sheer!&rdquo; cried the Union Commander.</p>

<p>The <i>Kearsarge</i> spun off and broke her long silence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg&nbsp;385]</a></span>
with the starboard battery. <em>Crash! Roar!</em> the shells
pounded around the great privateer, and, with a full
head of steam, the corsair of the Southern Confederacy
swept onward. <em>Crash! Roar!</em> she answered
with shell, and the bursting iron shivered the foremast
of her doughty opponent.</p>

<p>Captain Winslow was fearful that the enemy would
make for the shore, so he spun over his helm to port
in the endeavor to run under the <i>Alabama</i>&rsquo;s stern and
rake her. But she sheered off, kept her broadside
to him, and pounded away like a pugilist. The ships
were a quarter of a mile (440 yards) away from each
other. They were circling around in a wide arc, plugging
away as fast as they could load. The spectators
cheered, for it was as good a show as they had ever
witnessed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eet ees fine!&rdquo; said the veteran of the Crimea.
&ldquo;Eet remin&rsquo; me of ze battaile at Balaklava!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly a wild cheer rose from the deck of the
United States cruiser. A shot had struck the spanker-gaff
on the enemy and her ensign had come down on
the run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurray!&rdquo; shouted the seamen. &ldquo;That means
we&rsquo;ll win, sure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fallen ensign re-appeared at the mizzen, while
firing from the <i>Alabama</i> became rapid and wild. The
gunners of the <i>Kearsarge</i> had been cautioned against
shooting without direct aim, and had been told to point
their heavy guns below, rather than above the water-line.</p>

<p>Captain Winslow was busy with his orders.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg&nbsp;386]</a></span>
&ldquo;Clear the enemy&rsquo;s deck with the light guns!&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;Sink the Confederate with the heavy
iron!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cheer succeeded cheer from his sailors. Caps were
thrown into the air, or overboard. Jackets were
tossed aside. Now, certain of victory, the men were
shouting wildly, as each projectile took effect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down, boys, down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give her another like the last!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;we have her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vessels continued to swing around each other
in wide circles, and&mdash;at this moment&mdash;a sixty-eight
pound Blakely shell passed through the starboard bulwarks
of the <i>Kearsarge</i> below the main rigging, exploded
on the quarter-deck, and wounded three of
the crew of the after pivot-gun. The three unfortunate
men were speedily taken below, but the act was
done so quietly, that&mdash;at the termination of the fight&mdash;a
large number of the crew were unaware that any
of their comrades were injured.</p>

<p>Two shots now crashed through the port-holes occupied
by the thirty-two pounders; one exploded in
the hammock-netting; the other shrieked through the
opposite port; yet no one was hurt. Fire blazed from
the deck; the alarm calling for fire-quarters was
sounded, and the men who had been detailed for this
emergency put it out. The rest stayed at the guns.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="men_shouting_wildly" id="men_shouting_wildly"></a>
<img src="images/fpas22.jpg" width="600" height="363" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;THE MEN WERE SHOUTING WILDLY, AS EACH PROJECTILE TOOK EFFECT.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eleven-inch shells were doing terrible execution
upon the quarter-deck of the <i>Alabama</i>. Three of
them crashed into the eight-inch pivot-gun port; the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg&nbsp;387]</a></span>
first swept off the forward part of the gun&rsquo;s crew;
the second killed one man and wounded several others;
the third struck the breast of the gun-carriage and
spun around on the deck until one of the men picked
it up and threw it overboard. The ship was careening
heavily to starboard, while the decks were covered
with the dead and dying. A shell plunged into the
coal bunker and a dense cloud of coal dust arose.
Crippled and torn, the hulking privateer began to
settle by the stern. Her guns still spat and growled,
and her broadsides were going wild. She was fast
weakening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any one who silences that after pivot-gun will
get one hundred dollars!&rdquo; cried Captain Semmes, as
he saw the fearful accuracy of its fire.</p>

<p><em>Crash!</em> a whole broadside from the privateer spat
at this particular piece. It was in vain.</p>

<p>Around and around circled the belching <i>Kearsarge</i>.
Seven times she had swooped about the weakening
gladiator of the sea, and her fire was more and more
accurate. She was like a great eagle closing in for
a deaththrust. Captain Semmes was in a desperate
situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoist the fore-trysail and jibs!&rdquo; he called out
above the din of cannon. &ldquo;Head for the French
coast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the sailors scrambled to obey, the <i>Alabama</i> presented
her port battery to the <i>Kearsarge</i>. She showed
gaping sides and only two guns were bearing.</p>

<p>At this moment the chief engineer came up on the
deck of the privateer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg&nbsp;388]</a></span>
&ldquo;The fires are all out and the engines will not
work!&rdquo; he reported to Captain Semmes.</p>

<p>The doughty seaman turned to his chief executive
officer, Mr. Kell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go below, sir,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;and see how long the
ship can float!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few moments the sailor had returned from his
inspection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain!&rdquo; cried he, saluting. &ldquo;She will not stay
on the sea for ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The face of the Confederate was ashen, as he answered,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, sir, cease firing, shorten sail, and haul down
the colors. It will never do in this Nineteenth Century
for us to go down with the decks covered with
our gallant wounded!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking, a broadside roared from the
side of his sinking vessel. The ensign of the <i>Kearsarge</i>
had been stopped (rolled up and tied with a
piece of twine) and, as a shell crashed through her
rigging, a piece hit the flag-halyards&mdash;parted them&mdash;and
unstopped the flag. It unfurled itself gallantly
in the breeze, and, as its beautiful striping waved aloft,
the sailors upon the deck gave a loud cheer, for this
was the omen of Victory.</p>

<p>At this moment, two of the junior officers upon the
<i>Alabama</i> swore that they would never surrender, and,
in a spirit of mutiny, rushed to the two port guns
and opened fire upon the Union vessel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is playing us a trick!&rdquo; shouted Winslow.
&ldquo;Give him another broadside!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg&nbsp;389]</a></span>
Again the shot and shell went crashing through
the sides of the Confederate cruiser. The <i>Kearsarge</i>
was laid across her bows for raking, and, in a position
to use grape and canister.</p>

<p>A white flag was then shown over the stern of the
<i>Alabama</i> and her ensign was half-masted; Union
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cease firing!&rdquo; shouted Captain Winslow.</p>

<p>The great fight was over. It had lasted one hour
and two minutes.</p>

<p><em>Chugety, plug, splash!</em> The boats were lowered
from the <i>Alabama</i>, and her Master&rsquo;s mate rowed to
the <i>Kearsarge</i>, with a few of his wounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are sinking,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You must come and
help us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does Captain Semmes surrender his ship?&rdquo; asked
Winslow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. Then I&rsquo;ll help you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fullam grinned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I return with this boat and crew in order
to rescue the drowning?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I pledge you
my word of honor that I will then come on board and
surrender.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Winslow granted his request.</p>

<p>With less generosity, the victorious Commander
could have detained the officers and men, supplied their
places with his own sailors, and offered equal aid to
the distressed. His generosity was abused. Fullam
pulled to the midst of the drowning; rescued several
officers; went to the yacht <i>Deerhound</i>, and cast his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg&nbsp;390]</a></span>
boat adrift; leaving a number of men struggling in
the water.</p>

<p>The <i>Alabama</i> was settling fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All hands overboard!&rdquo; cried Mr. Kell. &ldquo;Let
every man grab a life-preserver, or a spar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the sailors plunged into the sea, Captain Semmes
dropped his sword into the waves and leaped outward,
with a life-preserver around his waist. Kell followed,
while the <i>Alabama</i> launched her bows high in the air,
and&mdash;graceful, even in her death throes&mdash;plunged
stern-foremost into the deep. A sucking eddy of
foam, spars, and wreckage marked where once had
floated the gallant ship.</p>

<p>Thus sank the terror of the merchantmen&mdash;riddled
through and through&mdash;and no cheer arose as her battered
hulk went down in forty-five fathoms of water.
Her star had set.</p>

<p>The <i>Deerhound</i> had kept about a mile to windward
of the two contestants, but she now steamed towards
the mass of living heads, which dotted the surface of
the sea. Her two boats were lowered, and Captain
Semmes was picked up and taken aboard, with forty
others. She then edged to the leeward and steamed
rapidly away.</p>

<p>An officer quickly approached Captain Winslow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better fire a shot at the yacht,&rdquo; he said, saluting.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got Captain Semmes aboard and will run off
with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Winslow smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s simply coming
around!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg&nbsp;391]</a></span>
But the <i>Deerhound</i> kept on.</p>

<p>Another officer approached the commander of the
<i>Kearsarge</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That beastly yacht is carrying off our men,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;Better bring her to, Captain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No Englishman who carries the flag of the
Royal Yacht Squadron can so act!&rdquo; Winslow replied,&mdash;somewhat
pettishly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s simply coming
around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she never &ldquo;came around,&rdquo; and Captain Raphael
Semmes was soon safe upon British soil. He had
fought a game fight. The superior gunnery of the
sailors of the <i>Kearsarge</i> had been too much for him.
Nine of his crew were dead and twenty-one wounded,
while the <i>Kearsarge</i> had no one killed and but
three wounded; one of whom died shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>Thus,&mdash;the lesson is:</p>

<p>If you want to win: Learn how to shoot
straight!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Captain Raphael Semmes died quietly at Mobile,
Alabama, August 30th, 1877. His ill-fated <i>Alabama</i>
had inflicted a loss of over seven million dollars upon
the commerce of the United States.</p>

<p>A number of wise men met, many years afterwards,
in Geneva, Switzerland, and decided, that, as the British
Government had allowed this vessel to leave their
shores, when warned by the American minister of her
character and intention to go privateering, it should
therefore pay for all the vessels which the graceful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg&nbsp;392]</a></span>
cruiser had destroyed. England had broken the neutrality
laws.</p>

<p>John Bull paid up.</p>

<p>
But,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&mdash;Boys&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">it</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">hurt!</span><br />

<span class="i0">The rotting hulk its decking rears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gray, screaming kestrels wheel and sheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the wasted steering gear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In moulding kelp and mackerel&rsquo;s sheen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blighted log-book hides unseen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red flash the beams of northern blaze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through beaded clouds of Elmo&rsquo;s haze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While dim, unkempt, the ghostly crew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Float by, and chant the lesson true!<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sons of the fog-bound Northland; sons of the blinding seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ye would cherish the trust which your fathers left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye must strive&mdash;ye must work&mdash;without ease.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong have your good sires battled, oft have your fathers bled,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The shimmering icebergs call you; the plunging screw-drums scream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By shallowing shoals they haul you, to the beat of the walking beam.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The twisting petrels chatter, as ye drift by the waiting fleet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In your towering grim, gray Dreadnought,&mdash;a king who sneers at defeat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the silken pennons flutter; as the frozen halyards strain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes the growling old-world mutter, the voice of the million slain:<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Keep to your manly war games; keep to your warrior&rsquo;s play.</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Arbitrate if you have to; smooth it o&rsquo;er if you must,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But, be prepared for battle, to parry the war king&rsquo;s thrust.</i><br /></span>
